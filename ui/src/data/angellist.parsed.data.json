        "description": "<p>Have you ever wanted to know what it is like to build a startup from the ground up? If you’ve ever wanted to found your own company, or just get experience of scale at this unique stage - this is the role for you.</p>\n\n<p>In this role you will do many things that might be familiar as a Principal, Full-Stack, or another type of Engineer. What’s different about a Founding Engineer is you’re first building a company and a culture. And the customer and product follows that.</p>\n\n<p>What we really want in a Founding Engineer is someone who wants build something great from the ground up. More importantly, someone that wants to share the experience with a great team.</p>\n<h3>Who are we?</h3>\n<p>Our mission is to create calmer organizations. With Pyn, employees get more of the messages they need, and fewer of the ones they don’t. We do this by providing companies with tools for targeted, tailored communications.</p>\n\n<p>Our founders are Jon Williams and Joris Luijke. Jon previously co-founded the technology company Culture Amp. Joris helped scale the culture of Atlassian and Squarespace as their Head of People. Pyn is backed by Accel; an early investor in Facebook, Slack, Dropbox, and many more great companies.</p>\n\n<p>Pyn originates from Sydney, Australia. However, we have employees and customers across the globe. While we work remotely, we still love to get together if and when we can. Ideally our employees have good overlap with the Australian Eastern or Pacific time zones.</p>\n<h3>Your impact</h3>\n<p>As Founding Engineer, you will champion new features all the way from ideation to implementation. As this champion, you will be talking to our customers every day.</p>\n\n<p>At Pyn, you will work across the whole organization. Everything from building our Web Application, to helping customers, mentoring engineers, and building our culture.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of nuts and bolts: The Pyn Application uses React and GraphQL. The codebase is largely TypeScript and deployed on a serverless AWS infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>We expect this architecture to evolve considerably as we grow. As a Founding Engineer, you’ll be responsible for technical direction in this evolution. You will be a key part of Pyn shipping fast, scaling up, and staying secure for our customers.</p>\n<h3>What we offer</h3>\n<p>At Pyn you will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>work directly with the Founders on product direction, strategy, and execution.</li>\n<li>be part of forming our values, and a leader for the culture we are building.</li>\n<li>work with Jon and the team on the software architecture and strategy.</li>\n<li>have regular, direct contact with our customers to understand their needs.</li>\n<li>use your experience to mentor and grow other team members.</li>\n<li>* be in a dynamic remote-work environment, with flexible hours and parental leave.</li>\n<li>exercise your curiosity and grow technical, product, and people skills.</li>\n<li>continue to ship code daily (if not hourly!) to get value to customers hands as soon as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>… change the way companies communicate with their employees.</p>\n<h3>What you bring</h3>\n<p>We recognize that people and careers are a unique journey. Recognizing this, we do not have strict skill and education requirements. Whilst there will always be specific skills we see as useful, we value the whole of what you can bring to Pyn.</p>\n\n<p>As one of our most senior hires, we want to draw upon your experience. As such it’s likely you’re a number of years into your career (or careers!). Whilst a traditional engineering background will suit this, so will many others.</p>\n\n<p>We’re striving to create a diverse environment and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. If you’re curious and passionate about improving employee communications, then we’d love to hear from you.</p>",

Millions of baby-boomers are retiring and are facing a tough problem of enjoying their retirement without running out of money. Our digital platform tailors a personalized drawdown strategy for them and assists them to stick by it. By addressing the unique financial circumstances of retirees, PaceIt is poised to become the one-stop solution for all the boomers’ financial needs. </p>\n\n<p>We are four founders with many years of combined experience in the retirement space.  We have been helping individuals accumulate for retirement and have realized that there is no good solution to guide them through withdrawals once those individuals retire. We are leveraging our experience and wide network with retirement plan providers and record keepers to distribute our solution. We have already signed a major 401(k) record keeper as our launch partner. We are now focused on building our core team towards a launch of our MVP in 2021. The company is well funded to achieve that goal. </p>\n\n<p>We’re currently looking for a phenomenal financial engineer with data science capabilities for an unpaid internship starting on June 21, 2021. The internship will allow you to grow and to take part in a multi-disciplinary development effort. Two of the founders are UCLA professors with many years of experience coaching graduate students. </p>\n\n<p>Example of the tasks that you might be asked to complete:<br>\n• Develop Monte Carlo simulations for modeling retirement portfolios.<br>\n• Use machine learning algorithms to improve portfolio modeling. <br>\n• Analyze transaction data and develop algorithms for tracking individuals spending versus their budgets. <br>\n• Develop machine learning algorithm to predict life expectancy and spending patterns of retirees.</p>\n\n<p>Requirements:<br>\n• Previous work in a start-up and/or hi-tech environment is a plus.<br>\n• Experience modeling investment risk and return using Monte Carlo simulations.<br>\n• Experience using statistical computer languages (mostly Python) to manipulate data and draw insights from large data sets.<br>\n• Knowledge of a variety of machine learning techniques (clustering, tree-based techniques, artificial neural networks, etc.) and their real-world advantages/drawbacks. Familiarity with Tensor flow and Keras is a plus. <br>\n• Knowledge of advanced statistical techniques and concepts (regression, properties of distributions, statistical tests and proper usage, etc.) and experience with applications.<br>\n• A drive to learn and master new technologies and techniques.<br>\n• Previous experience with cloud technology (AWS in particular) is an advantage. </p>\n\n<p>This is a rare opportunity to take part in a high-growth venture at an early stage and help build a company with an important mission. If you want to do good and do well, help us create a needed financial solution for the many baby boomers retiring every day.</p>",

Our organisation is guided by 3 foundational principles: </p>\n\n<p>*** The Theory of Small Wins<strong>: we know that the task before us is massive but we move fast and celebrate every little victory along the way, because every win is part of a more global step in the right direction.<br>\n*** The Two Loop Theory of Organizational Change</strong>: this theory suggest that change emerges in human systems out of a spontaneous series of local actions, and these local actions spontaneously link together both organically and purposefully in ways that facilitate the development of integrated networks of relationships that are aligned in the pursuit of mutual interests and goals.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Theory Positive Change Cycle</strong>: this one refers to the cycle of emotions experienced when someone discovers that important change is upcoming, and demonstrates the importance of being an actor of that change as a way to transform the negative emotions into positive ones.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We're are building a different kind of organisation.

Data teams are the most interdisciplinary teams ever created: Analysts, Scientists, Engineers, Business; Diverse people with their own tooling preferences and skillsets and \"DNA\" that need to come together and collaborate effectively. Leading to collaboration chaos.</p>\n\n<p>We would be awoken with crisis calls every second day for the minutest of issues - from troubleshooting why number on a dashboard is incorrect to getting access to the right dataset! Atlan started as us building small tools to make our own data team more agile.</p>\n\n<p>Over a couple of years, we made our team 6X more agile and went on to do amazing things like build India's National Data Platform used by its Prime Minister. (data for 500M citizens, built by an 8 member team, fastest project of its kind to go live — in 12 months instead of projected 3 years)</p>\n\n<p>💡 Could the tooling we built for ourselves help data teams around the world? That's how Atlan was born. We're on the mission to help data teams around the world do their lives' best work.</p>\n\n<p>Read our cofounder, Prukalpa's article about our vision for the future of data collaboration and our journey of failing 3 times before we figured out the real solution.</p>\n\n<p>🚀 We're growing fast</p>\n\n<p>We've grown 16X in just the last 6 months 📈</p>\n\n<p>We were named a Gartner Cool Vendor in DataOps, one of the Top 3 companies globally (one of the fastest companies to make the list 🌏)</p>\n\n<p>We're backed by iconic investors, including Sequoia Capital, Waterbridge Ventures and Mr. Ratan Tata 🏅</p>\n\n<p>Watch this 3 minute video of our journey so far &amp; where we're going (in conversation with Sequoia Capital).</p>\n\n<p>We build with all our ❤️<br>\nWe believe that data teams deserve fundamentally better software experiences.... Just because data is chaos, doesn't mean that work should be! 🌟</p>\n\n<p>Love what Superhuman, Slack, Notion, Quip &amp; Figma have done for the modern workplace? Come build the future for data teams with Atlan.</p>\n\n<p>What will you do? 🤔</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Work across verticals to design an eye-catching and responsive user interface, make the user experience on our platform simple and seamless and implement the background functionality in the most cost-effective and memory-friendly way.</li>\n<li>Collaborate with our Engineering Team to set up integrations and design the storage and querying infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Set up SDKs to interact with the backend over HTTP in the most secure and object-oriented way.</li>\n<li>Bring new features by building beautiful and intuitive interfaces for our users.</li>\n<li>Help the team design user flows and iterate the product based on feedback from our customer-facing teams.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What makes you a match for us? 😍</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You have experience with multiple front-end frameworks or are proficient in at least one frontend framework.</li>\n<li>You have a disciplined approach to writing unit tests and ensuring code quality.</li>\n<li>You care about scale, quality, structured readable code (preferably in MVC patterns), cross-platform and cross-browser issues, and module reusability, even before approaching the problem.</li>\n<li>You have a strong awareness and keep up to date with the latest industry trends and developments.</li>\n<li>You have a knack for experimenting and trying out the latest technologies.</li>\n<li>You have strong critical thinking skills—i.e. you demonstrate the ability to deconstruct a problem into its base components and figure out the most effective way to solve it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Working at Atlan 👨‍💻 👩‍💻</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/atlanhq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">We love open-source.

Details fall through the cracks, generic printouts you receive end up in the trash, and important information never makes it to other doctors. Ultimately, you’re left needing to connect the dots in your care. That’s why we started Abridge with a simple thesis: if we can shift agency to consumers, we can help them stay on top of their health. When you use Abridge to record your health conversations, the conversations themselves become your medical record. It’s as easy as that.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for research interns to working on exciting NLP challenges using our large annotated proprietary healthcare datasets. You will be able to create/customize your internship research statement and collaborate with our in-house Machine Learning research team. At the end of the internship, you will also have the opportunity to publish your work at top tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, NAACL, and ACL. </p>\n\n<p>The goal of the internship is to advance the state-of-the-art in one or many of the following research areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dialog Understanding </li>\n<li>Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling</li>\n<li>Clinical Natural Language Processing</li>\n<li>Information Extraction</li>\n<li>Machine Learning using Ontologies or Knowledge graphs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Required Qualification:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Must be accepted to or currently enrolled in an MS or Ph.D. program in Computer Science or a related field</li>\n<li>Must have at least one NLP machine learning paper submitted or published </li>\n<li>Experience in utilizing theoretical and empirical research to solve problems</li>\n<li>Ability to communicate complex research ideas in a clear, precise, and actionable manner</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*Research internships are offered year-round with flexible durations</p>\n\n<p>Compensation</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$80,000-$100,000 per year</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Life at Abridge</p>\n\n<p>At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.</p>\n\n<p>Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and believe that \"you need to taste good things to have good taste.\"</p>\n\n<p>Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).</p>",

When I couldn't consistently find pickup basketball in NYC, I found a problem I wanted to work on. To that end, the GoodRun mission is to advance basketball culture by digitizing the ecosystem of basketball-related activities and transactions. </p>\n\n<p>Today, GoodRun is a platform to help users find competitive pickup basketball games in their city. Eventually, GoodRun will be <strong>the online destination for all amateur pickup basketball activity</strong>: play games on-demand, host games using admin tools, track skills and performance, and meet new hoop friends. </p>\n\n<p>🙋‍♂️ Me: My primary skillset is product management and marketing. I've independently operated and managed a few small businesses in the past and hope to continue building businesses for the foreseeable future. I studied Mechanical Engineering in college and built the current MVP myself.

Starting with basketball, I hope to change the way people and communities are brought together for recreation.

Most of the original founding members were modders developing the total conversion Middle Earth Roleplaying Project (MERP) mod for the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.moddb.com/mods/merp-middle-earth-roleplaying-project\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.moddb.com/mods/merp-middle-earth-roleplaying-project</a></p>\n\n<p>Currently Epoch Games is developing Lays of Althas: Sundered Order (LoA:SO). LoA:SO is an in-development indie open-world RPG set in an original fantasy world. The game is being developed using Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4 (UE4):<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.unrealengine.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>For more information about the game, please check out our IndieDb page:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.indiedb.com/games/the-lays-of-althas-sundered-order\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.indiedb.com/games/the-lays-of-althas-sundered-order</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Although Epoch Games does have a formal office at the listed address, we have a fully-online team at this time.

        "description": "<p>W3LL’s wellbeing exploration and discovery platform is an APP with SMS messaging, engaging/encouraging nudges (our secret sauce!), peer-to-peer support thru AI matched affinity groups (more secret sauce), and wellbeing resources that are easy to access and use. Most importantly, W3LL makes our community healthier, happier, and more hopeful. </p>\n\n<p>We are an early stage startup with lots of hats to wear. W3LL wants to give a voice to the senior community. Our thesis: When you share your voice, your experiences, your perspectives - it helps us all see each other in ourselves or see ourselves in each other. It is healing. It is educational. It is something that connects us all. W3LL is building a community platform that will collect the stories of older adults/seniors and turn them into podcasts. We are seeking a design/development intern to support the following.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Community Building - We are following the “Build In The Open (BitO)” framework to build a senior community around sharing insights, wisdoms, and perspectives. We want our community to tell us what questions they want to be asked, and how they want to share (short 2 min clips, longer podcast, conversations). </li>\n<li>Content Creator - Collect insights, wisdoms, perspectives from the AgeW3LL community. Create long and short form audio to share on the AgeW3ll platform and social channels. </li>\n<li>Story Teller - Find the narratives. Craft the story arcs. Tell the stories that resonate with the W3LL community and beyond. Imagine crafting the story arc of seniors' experiences during Covid? What did they miss the most? What are they most excited about post Covid? This is just the beginning.</li>\n<li>LA/Berkeley based - preferred. Virtual internship - Ok.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>W3LL is building a wellbeing exploration and discovery platform for seniors. We feel that giving a voice to older adults is a great place to begin! In the last 11 months, we have run 2 senior discovery cohorts, meet with seniors and B2B partners and we have learned a lot. seniors want easy to find, easy to access, easy to use low tech + no tech solutions. Most importantly, they want a community that listens and values what they have to say. </p>\n\n<p>We are looking for our 2021 team! We are looking for candidates that want to change the world, and improve access to wellbeing/mental health resources. People with interests in positive psychology, neuroscience,and in transformative technology. </p>\n\n<p>What will you get working with W3LL?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Opportunity: Experience working with emerging Transformative Technologies. </li>\n<li>Visionary Product: Be part of the team that is building a marketplace that changes lives.<br></li>\n<li>Access: W3LL is working with a visionary group of transformative technology thinkers, innovators, entrepreneurs, and artists who want to change the world. </li>\n<li>Training: Opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects (AI/ML, data analytics, product development, biz development, and social media/marketing).</li>\n<li>References/Recommendation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please include your resume, and tell us what makes you unique!

        "description": "<p>A BIT ABOUT US<br>\nGBatteries was founded six years ago to tackle one of the world’s most pressing issues: the transition to a cleaner future through electrification. We are pioneering battery technology which enables ultra-fast charging of Li-ion batteries without compromising battery life — and without changing the battery’s chemistry or manufacturing process. Ultimately, our mission is to accelerate the mass adoption of electric vehicles.<br>\nWe are working on some of the biggest challenges in energy storage, and are looking for the right people to join us as we develop our technology and continue to scale.</p>\n\n<p>THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE ROLE<br>\n As a DevOps Engineer on our Software Development team, you'll help us build out the core web applications and tools that will serve to enable our research and development teams to effectively test and analyze state-of-the-art batteries. In our small but growing engineering organization, you'll not only be developing and shipping new features but also designing core aspects of GBatteries' testing and data analysis product.<br>\nIn this role you’ll build a continuous integration pipeline to allow the Software team to release features faster and more frequently. You’ll be also creating a QA testing framework so that the team can write and run automated tests in a predefined environment. You will be involved in identifying and fixing bugs, documenting our research platform, and providing support to the Research team in using the research platform.</p>\n\n<p>We've not set it in stone, however our preferred salary range for this  position is $17-28 per hour, depending on experience and background. </p>\n\n<p>THE TEAM<br>\n You’ll join a small but growing software team where everyone—including you—is striving to constantly improve their knowledge of infrastructure, systems, and cares about creating dependable products. While we are still growing and have plenty to do, we are incredibility supportive of each other and pitch in to support our peers when problems arise.</p>\n\n<p>THE TECH STACK<br>\nThis is the tech stack our development team works with.<br>\nWeb Development: React.js, Flask<br>\nData Warehousing: Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL<br>\nDevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, Terraform, Ansible</p>\n\n<p>THE SKILL SET<br>\nComputer science or related background<br>\nPrevious experience in at least 1 software development role in industry</p>\n\n<p>Must haves:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Strong proficiency in Python</li>\n<li>Experience with Git version control (personal projects and/or work experience)</li>\n<li>Familiar with Docker (personal projects and/or work experience)</li>\n<li>Familiar with working using      the command line in Linux/Unix/Ubuntu (or similar environment)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Nice to haves:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Experience with Kubernetes (either deploying applications or managing a cluster)</li>\n<li>Experience with a cloud service provider (Azure preferred)</li>\n<li>Experience writing queries for Elasticsearch</li>\n<li>Experience working with CI/CD pipelines (CircleCI, Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub CI)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>WITHIN 1 MONTH, YOU'LL... </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Become familiar with our vertically integrated technology stack and get a high-level understanding of the projects the team is working on and how they fit in with the company’s goals</li>\n<li>Start development on your first Python-based project which will be a continuous integration pipeline to allow the software team to release new features faster and more frequently</li>\n<li>This tool will be capable of executing/managing Helm charts to deploy new versions of the software to a Kubernetes cluster</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>WITHIN 2 MONTHS, YOU'LL... </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Begin working on a QA testing framework that will allow for developers to write and run automated tests in a predefined environment</li>\n<li>This will be python based, and will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline built in the previous project</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>WITHIN 4 MONTHS, YOU'LL... </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Continue to implement new features for the CI/CD pipeline and QA testing framework you build during your term. This may involve integration with a second Kubernetes cluster hosted in Azure, and any bug fixes that may arise</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>THE ENGINEERING CULTURE</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Autonomy: There's no red tape on what technology frameworks you can use, or what language you should be coding in. We believe in using the best tool(s) for the job, and learning any new ones along the way.</li>\n<li>Scope: You won't be adding small features to a monolithic codebase; you will be building entire products from start to finish. Your team members will recognize you for the products you build and the impact these products have on their workflow. You will have the opportunity to identify the business needs for a particular product, work through the development life cycle, and interact with your customers directly. </li>\n<li>Interesting Problems: Much of what we do is in uncharted territories. As a result, we are often posed with interesting and challenging engineering problems, which will encourage you to prototype, iterate, and innovate. It's part of the company culture to encourage crazy ideas, and celebrate failures as learning opportunities. Many of the design problems you will encounter won't have answers on Google or Stack Overflow, they will encourage you to come up with unique approaches and strengthen your design thinking.</li>\n<li>Growth: Working at a start-up is a great way to supercharge your skillset, and accelerate your learning. You will be put in a fast-paced environment where you're always working at the bleeding edge of technology.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>WHAT WE OFFER<br>\nWe are working on many exciting projects towards our ultimate goal of breaking down the final barrier preventing the adoption of electric vehicles; range anxiety. We’re a growing company working with some of the largest manufacturers in the world, and there’s still a huge amount to do. Even as an intern joining us, you’ll be able to see the impact of your work from day one and have the opportunity to see the final effect on real world products. We encourage unconventional thinking, and seek resilient problem solvers who aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty.</p>\n\n<p>During the pandemic, we are operating remote-by-default.</p>\n\n<p>HOW TO APPLY<br>\nIs the idea of enabling the global mass adoption of electric vehicles exciting to you? We’d love to hear from you! To apply please include a short message addressed to Henry Rearden within the application below; no cover letter necessary. If you have any questions, or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out to Vlad Belov on LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p>We particularly value diversity, and we know that experience comes in many forms.

Think that businesses can do good? Recapture is currently seeking out a Corporate Emissions Associate to sculpt the next phase of corporate climate action. We are a passionate gang looking for someone passionate, hopeful, data driven and hardworking to help us fulfill our vision of making Recapture the enterprise carbon removal standard.</p>\n<h3>About Recapture</h3>\n<p>Recapture is a Washington, DC based company founded in 2018 by Philip-Michael Weiner and Trey Pringle’s search for solutions to close the carbon gap. This spurred a two year journey to design economically sensible ways for companies to eliminate their footprint. But now the notion of carbon neutral has changed. It used to be offset what you can’t reduce through projects that avoid emissions somewhere else on the planet; however, now companies need to mathematically remove 1 ton of carbon for each ton they emit.</p>\n\n<p>Since that time, Recapture has evolved from an to a new model for carbon removal that makes it profitable for the largest companies to solve climate change.</p>\n\n<p>At a minimum, 100 billion metric tons of CO2 needs to be removed from the atmosphere by mid-century in order to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. Unfortunately, the current natural and technological approaches that pull carbon from the air have feasibility or cost limitations when used on their own that prevent them from scaling to the size of the problem. And even though the U.S. might be back on track to reduce emissions, without legislation, the financial mechanism has been missing in the carbon removal space. So we created that missing link.</p>\n\n<p>Our vision is to harness the collective power of the Global Fortune 1000 to reach net-zero and halt the progression of global warming in our lifetime. We pioneered the first profitable carbon removal strategy, have the system-designed model and global partners in place, and the financial flywheel to enable direct air capture (DAC) to scale through finance, construction, and innovation through our actual sales, instead of investment or subsidization alone.</p>\n<h3>The Program Areas</h3>\n<p>Recapture invites you to come join us for a unique remote experience, including an 11-22 week for college credit, professional development programming, mentoring, and network-building.

We need to determine our options, model out the possibilities, and test these hypotheses with real customers</p></li>\n<li><p>Defining the target customer: There are hundreds of thousands of e-commerce stores, if not millions. The question is simple - which of them would be good candidates for the IntelliGems service? We need to segment the market, determine the sizes of various segments, and use this to inform our business development strategy</p></li>\n<li><p>Build the go-to-market plan: Most of our customers have come through referrals and networking. As we scale, we will need to be more proactive in finding customers. We need to determine what channels are most effective for e-commerce enablement companies, and run some initial tests to gauge effectiveness</p></li>\n<li><p>Product development/management: As we better understand our target customer and go-to-market plan, we will need to tailor the product to these segments. In particular, we want to build a feature that suggests which tests a customer should run. This person might talk to customers and work with our engineers to define this feature</p></li>\n<li><p>Lots of other stuff - We’re a scrappy team and have far more to-do than our capacity. Depending on the candidate’s interests and skills, they could plug into content development, design, fundraising strategy, customer success, and data science</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should apply if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You thrive in ambiguous environments where there’s not a single “right” answer - you have an intuition for what’s the most important thing, and a knack for finding 80/20 solutions</p></li>\n<li><p>You are a flexible thinker who loves switching between creative work, data analysis, problem solving, and customer interviews</p></li>\n<li><p>You love tough problems, and aren’t scared off if they can get ‘math-y’ in nature</p></li>\n<li><p>You’re down-to-earth, have a good sense of humor, and like to be friendly with the people you work with</p></li>\n<li><p>You want to get exposure to an early company and see how things work at a young, seed-stage company</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can drop your resume here, but also highly enoucrage you to send one of us a note with your resume and explain why you're interested!</p>",
