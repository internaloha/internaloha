If you‚Äôve ever wanted to found your own company, or just get experience of scale at this unique stage - this is the role for you.</p>\n\n<p>In this role you will do many things that might be familiar as a Principal, Full-Stack, or another type of Engineer. What‚Äôs different about a Founding Engineer is you‚Äôre first building a company and a culture. And the customer and product follows that.</p>\n\n<p>What we really want in a Founding Engineer is someone who wants build something great from the ground up. More importantly, someone that wants to share the experience with a great team.</p>\n<h3>Who are we?</h3>\n<p>Our mission is to create calmer organizations. With Pyn, employees get more of the messages they need, and fewer of the ones they don‚Äôt. We do this by providing companies with tools for targeted, tailored communications.</p>\n\n<p>Our founders are Jon Williams and Joris Luijke. Jon previously co-founded the technology company Culture Amp. Joris helped scale the culture of Atlassian and Squarespace as their Head of People. Pyn is backed by Accel; an early investor in Facebook, Slack, Dropbox, and many more great companies.</p>\n\n<p>Pyn originates from Sydney, Australia. However, we have employees and customers across the globe. While we work remotely, we still love to get together if and when we can. Ideally our employees have good overlap with the Australian Eastern or Pacific time zones.</p>\n<h3>Your impact</h3>\n<p>As Founding Engineer, you will champion new features all the way from ideation to implementation. As this champion, you will be talking to our customers every day.</p>\n\n<p>At Pyn, you will work across the whole organization. Everything from building our Web Application, to helping customers, mentoring engineers, and building our culture.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of nuts and bolts: The Pyn Application uses React and GraphQL. The codebase is largely TypeScript and deployed on a serverless AWS infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>We expect this architecture to evolve considerably as we grow. As a Founding Engineer, you‚Äôll be responsible for technical direction in this evolution. You will be a key part of Pyn shipping fast, scaling up, and staying secure for our customers.</p>\n<h3>What we offer</h3>\n<p>At Pyn you will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>work directly with the Founders on product direction, strategy, and execution.</li>\n<li>be part of forming our values, and a leader for the culture we are building.</li>\n<li>work with Jon and the team on the software architecture and strategy.</li>\n<li>have regular, direct contact with our customers to understand their needs.</li>\n<li>use your experience to mentor and grow other team members.</li>\n<li>* be in a dynamic remote-work environment, with flexible hours and parental leave.</li>\n<li>exercise your curiosity and grow technical, product, and people skills.</li>\n<li>continue to ship code daily (if not hourly!) to get value to customers hands as soon as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>‚Ä¶ change the way companies communicate with their employees.</p>\n<h3>What you bring</h3>\n<p>We recognize that people and careers are a unique journey. Recognizing this, we do not have strict skill and education requirements. Whilst there will always be specific skills we see as useful, we value the whole of what you can bring to Pyn.</p>\n\n<p>As one of our most senior hires, we want to draw upon your experience. As such it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôre a number of years into your career (or careers!). Whilst a traditional engineering background will suit this, so will many others.</p>\n\n<p>We‚Äôre striving to create a diverse environment and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. If you‚Äôre curious and passionate about improving employee communications, then we‚Äôd love to hear from you.</p>",

Millions of baby-boomers are retiring and are facing a tough problem of enjoying their retirement without running out of money.

We have already signed a major 401(k) record keeper as our launch partner. We are now focused on building our core team towards a launch of our MVP in 2021. The company is well funded to achieve that goal. </p>\n\n<p>We‚Äôre currently looking for a phenomenal financial engineer with data science capabilities for an unpaid internship starting on June 21, 2021.

        "description": "<p>Canopy Analytics is hiring a software engineering intern. As part of the early team, you will be a strong individual contributor. You will delivering high-quality code quickly, and also be mentored by the rest of the team.</p>\n\n<p>Canopy Analytics is a small but mighty team. With just three founders, we bootstrapped an enterprise SaaS platform, grew +500% in the last year, raised a strong round from top-tier investors, and our customers depend on our software everyday. The key to our success has been a strong team obsessed with customer experience and great product engineering.</p>\n<h3>What you'll work on</h3>\n<p>We're a web based cloud platform. We build analytics, workflows and alerts that let our customer navigate their data. We update our system nightly through our ETL processes, translating customer data into a common format that's easy to query and visualize. Managing a common format requires deep understanding of our integrations. To manage the complexity, we focus on a strong writing/documentation culture, high test coverage, and keeping low technical debt. </p>\n\n<p>You'll work closely with Sameer Siruguri, CTO. He will help you navigate the codebase, coach you through problems we have encountered before, and set overall goals.</p>\n\n<p>When building features, you'll collaborate closely with Jessica Willis, head of design. You'll influence features at every step. You'll start with ETL, analyze the data, ensure the design reflects the data, and translate mockups into code. You'll also help Jessica understand technical nuance and negotiate scope.</p>\n<h3>Recent projects</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Feature:</strong> Track revenue changes in real time based on changes in the market and their strategy. This is an industry first and was done entirely manually previously.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Introduce Redis for SQL caching</li>\n<li><strong>Operations:</strong> Production data verification in our ETL pipeline</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tech stack</h3>\n<p>We use Ruby on Rails with server-rendered HTML. On the front end, Typescript is our primary language. We \"sprinkle\" interactivity using Stimulus and Chartist for visualizations. Our data is backed by Postgres and Redis. We make extensive use of window functions, rollup tables and caching to keep our application fast. We use RSpec and fixtures for testing (and our coverage is pretty good). The application is hosted on Heroku and we deploy multiple times a day. </p>\n\n<p>Our priorities are <strong>shipping velocity</strong> and <strong>correctness</strong>. We're thinking through:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What's the best way to catch bugs before they happen? Will gradual typing through Sorbet or RBI help?</li>\n<li>How can we build more interactive visualizations and product? Should we use StimulusReflex or Hotwire?</li>\n<li>How can we dynamically show the KPIs we think our customers should worry about throughout the data? What is the role of predictive analytics in this scenario?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mission</h3>\n<p>We started Canopy Analytics because we want more housing to be built so cities can be more affordable. We embedded ourselves in the commercial real estate industry to understand their business problems. We found that they didn't have the tools to adequately deal with their scale. This drives up costs and makes it hard to deploy capital. Our early customers have seen over $1M of impact annually and we've barely scratched the surface. Our vision is to be the software that operates and finances the next generation of cities. </p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We‚Äôre looking for someone with Ruby experience. Front-end programming experience, especially with Typescript and modern browser APIs, is a plus but not a requirement.</li>\n<li>Excellent project management skills is a must. Your ability to break down a complex task into smaller steps helps you anticipate what edge cases might have been ignored. You thoughtfully communicate potential solutions and delegate the decision.</li>\n<li>Written and verbal communication skills are highly valued. You proactively document and explain project status and technical details to both technical and non-technical audiences.</li>\n<li>You have the forensic skills to start with a bug report, track down the area of code that is causing the problem, and quickly identify a solution that can both address the bug and also improve the state of the codebase.</li>\n<li>You can proactively suggest ways to make our QA processes better, and ways in which the engineering team can create tooling that supports the QA team.</li>\n<li>No industry (real estate) experience is necessary but you have to be excited to empower a customer base of non-technical users. We want to hear your ideas about how to make this intuitive and fun.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Culture</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Our customer base is nearly 60% women and we're committed to building a diverse workforce which reflects our industry segment.</li>\n<li>We're a team first. No one should feel under appreciated or feel they can't do their best work because of someone else on the team.</li>\n<li>Invest in our people.

Data teams are the most interdisciplinary teams ever created: Analysts, Scientists, Engineers, Business; Diverse people with their own tooling preferences and skillsets and \"DNA\" that need to come together and collaborate effectively. Leading to collaboration chaos.</p>\n\n<p>We would be awoken with crisis calls every second day for the minutest of issues - from troubleshooting why number on a dashboard is incorrect to getting access to the right dataset! Atlan started as us building small tools to make our own data team more agile.</p>\n\n<p>Over a couple of years, we made our team 6X more agile and went on to do amazing things like build India's National Data Platform used by its Prime Minister. (data for 500M citizens, built by an 8 member team, fastest project of its kind to go live ‚Äî in 12 months instead of projected 3 years)</p>\n\n<p>üí° Could the tooling we built for ourselves help data teams around the world?

        "description": "<p>When you think about your last doctor‚Äôs appointment, how much do you actually recall? If you‚Äôre like most people, you‚Äôll likely forget over 40% of the conversation. Details fall through the cracks, generic printouts you receive end up in the trash, and important information never makes it to other doctors. Ultimately, you‚Äôre left needing to connect the dots in your care. That‚Äôs why we started Abridge with a simple thesis: if we can shift agency to consumers, we can help them stay on top of their health. When you use Abridge to record your health conversations, the conversations themselves become your medical record. It‚Äôs as easy as that.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for research interns to working on exciting NLP challenges using our large annotated proprietary healthcare datasets. You will be able to create/customize your internship research statement and collaborate with our in-house Machine Learning research team. At the end of the internship, you will also have the opportunity to publish your work at top tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, NAACL, and ACL. </p>\n\n<p>The goal of the internship is to advance the state-of-the-art in one or many of the following research areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dialog Understanding </li>\n<li>Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling</li>\n<li>Clinical Natural Language Processing</li>\n<li>Information Extraction</li>\n<li>Machine Learning using Ontologies or Knowledge graphs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Required Qualification:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Must be accepted to or currently enrolled in an MS or Ph.D. program in Computer Science or a related field</li>\n<li>Must have at least one NLP machine learning paper submitted or published </li>\n<li>Experience in utilizing theoretical and empirical research to solve problems</li>\n<li>Ability to communicate complex research ideas in a clear, precise, and actionable manner</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*Research internships are offered year-round with flexible durations</p>\n\n<p>Compensation</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$80,000-$100,000 per year</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Life at Abridge</p>\n\n<p>At Abridge, we‚Äôre driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the ‚Äúinverse‚Äù way in a legacy system‚Äîfocusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.</p>\n\n<p>Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds‚Äîan experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it‚Äôs holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and believe that \"you need to taste good things to have good taste.\"</p>\n\n<p>Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).</p>",

Around these building blocks, several modules based on ML methods can be used in the product: alerts, simulations, product intelligence, etc.</p>\n\n<p>We have different operating regimes: The retail/marketplace context requires generic methods with rapid inference frequencies (adaptation to market variations in near-real time) whereas in B2B we create customs models with batch inference on a very large amount of data.

We want to eradicate conscious and unconscious biases in pay based on colour, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, etc.</p>\n\n<p>As per UK‚Äôs Office for National Statistics, gender pay gap among full-time employees stood at 8.9% in 2019. OECD reported a striking 12.9% gender pay gap worldwide. This is an example of just one form of salary discrimination that has come to light. Add to this are the unconscious biases that we as humans have.</p>\n\n<p>The existing job portals and platforms aid this problem through their current means. Most of these portals allow professionals to estimate their expected compensation based on market demand by seeking their previous salary details, worsening the problem of salary discrimination even further. Other times, working professionals find it difficult to understand the exact salary to ask potential employers, or know what salary they deserve or if they are underpaid. </p>\n\n<p>While the job market industry may have many grey areas, we at Salaryse believe it is crucial for you to know what you truly deserve to be paid and that your salary should be based on your experience, education and skillset, that define you as a professional, and is not based on your looks. Salaryse does just that ‚Äì it estimates your salary based on YOUR unique experience, skills and education, along with the market demand. We believe your previous salary shouldn't determine your next salary. Our mission is to equip and empower you with a solid benchmark before you enter your next salary negotiation. The key to our future is our team and data. Our ambition is to create a platform for our current and future talent to thrive and grow with the business. </p>\n\n<p>We are a small team of young entrepreneurs with a vision to eliminate salary discrimination and bring equal pay at workplace. You will be working with a socially relevant and commercially important idea in today‚Äôs trying times. As we are a growing start-up, this 3-month internship may lead to a longer engagement.</p>",

We want to eradicate conscious and unconscious biases in pay based on colour, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, etc.</p>\n\n<p>As per UK‚Äôs Office for National Statistics, gender pay gap among full-time employees stood at 8.9% in 2019. OECD reported a striking 12.9% gender pay gap worldwide. This is an example of just one form of salary discrimination that has come to light. Add to this are the unconscious biases that we as humans have.</p>\n\n<p>The existing job portals and platforms aid this problem through their current means. Most of these portals allow professionals to estimate their expected compensation based on market demand by seeking their previous salary details, worsening the problem of salary discrimination even further. Other times, working professionals find it difficult to understand the exact salary to ask potential employers, or know what salary they deserve or if they are underpaid. </p>\n\n<p>While the job market industry may have many grey areas, we at Salaryse believe it is crucial for you to know what you truly deserve to be paid and that your salary should be based on your experience, education and skillset, that define you as a professional, and is not based on your looks. Salaryse does just that ‚Äì it estimates your salary based on YOUR unique experience, skills and education, along with the market demand. We believe your previous salary shouldn't determine your next salary. Our mission is to equip and empower you with a solid benchmark before you enter your next salary negotiation. The key to our future is our team and data. Our ambition is to create a platform for our current and future talent to thrive and grow with the business. </p>\n\n<p>We are a small team of young entrepreneurs with a vision to eliminate salary discrimination and bring equal pay at workplace. You will be working with a socially relevant and commercially important idea in today‚Äôs trying times. As we are a growing start-up, this 3-month internship may lead to a longer engagement.</p>",
