        "description": "<p>Have you ever wanted to know what it is like to build a startup from the ground up? If you’ve ever wanted to found your own company, or just get experience of scale at this unique stage - this is the role for you.</p>\n\n<p>In this role you will do many things that might be familiar as a Principal, Full-Stack, or another type of Engineer. What’s different about a Founding Engineer is you’re first building a company and a culture. And the customer and product follows that.</p>\n\n<p>What we really want in a Founding Engineer is someone who wants build something great from the ground up. More importantly, someone that wants to share the experience with a great team.</p>\n<h3>Who are we?</h3>\n<p>Our mission is to create calmer organizations. With Pyn, employees get more of the messages they need, and fewer of the ones they don’t. We do this by providing companies with tools for targeted, tailored communications.</p>\n\n<p>Our founders are Jon Williams and Joris Luijke. Jon previously co-founded the technology company Culture Amp. Joris helped scale the culture of Atlassian and Squarespace as their Head of People. Pyn is backed by Accel; an early investor in Facebook, Slack, Dropbox, and many more great companies.</p>\n\n<p>Pyn originates from Sydney, Australia. However, we have employees and customers across the globe. While we work remotely, we still love to get together if and when we can. Ideally our employees have good overlap with the Australian Eastern or Pacific time zones.</p>\n<h3>Your impact</h3>\n<p>As Founding Engineer, you will champion new features all the way from ideation to implementation. As this champion, you will be talking to our customers every day.</p>\n\n<p>At Pyn, you will work across the whole organization. Everything from building our Web Application, to helping customers, mentoring engineers, and building our culture.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of nuts and bolts: The Pyn Application uses React and GraphQL. The codebase is largely TypeScript and deployed on a serverless AWS infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>We expect this architecture to evolve considerably as we grow. As a Founding Engineer, you’ll be responsible for technical direction in this evolution. You will be a key part of Pyn shipping fast, scaling up, and staying secure for our customers.</p>\n<h3>What we offer</h3>\n<p>At Pyn you will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>work directly with the Founders on product direction, strategy, and execution.</li>\n<li>be part of forming our values, and a leader for the culture we are building.</li>\n<li>work with Jon and the team on the software architecture and strategy.</li>\n<li>have regular, direct contact with our customers to understand their needs.</li>\n<li>use your experience to mentor and grow other team members.</li>\n<li>* be in a dynamic remote-work environment, with flexible hours and parental leave.</li>\n<li>exercise your curiosity and grow technical, product, and people skills.</li>\n<li>continue to ship code daily (if not hourly!) to get value to customers hands as soon as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>… change the way companies communicate with their employees.</p>\n<h3>What you bring</h3>\n<p>We recognize that people and careers are a unique journey. Recognizing this, we do not have strict skill and education requirements. Whilst there will always be specific skills we see as useful, we value the whole of what you can bring to Pyn.</p>\n\n<p>As one of our most senior hires, we want to draw upon your experience. As such it’s likely you’re a number of years into your career (or careers!). Whilst a traditional engineering background will suit this, so will many others.</p>\n\n<p>We’re striving to create a diverse environment and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. If you’re curious and passionate about improving employee communications, then we’d love to hear from you.</p>",

Zipline uses drones to deliver critical and lifesaving medicine to thousands of hospitals serving millions of people in multiple countries. Our mission is to provide every human on Earth with instant access to vital medical supplies. Today, Zipline delivers thousands of pounds of medical supplies every week, and our delivery flights laid end-to-end would stretch to the Moon and back twice a month. We are at the forefront of a logistics revolution, using autonomous aircraft to deliver just-in-time, lifesaving medical supplies. Join Zipline and help us make this a reality for billions of people!</p>\n<h3><strong>About You and The Role</strong></h3><p><strong>Leading the way in drone delivery often means exceeding the capabilities of what's available off the shelf, and as a result we are engineering the majority of our system in-house. Doubling down on the reliability of our systems is critical to delivering to our next billion customers--people whose lives will be meaningfully affected by smarter, more equitable access. We are deliberately expanding our electrical capabilities and adding to the ranks of our experienced team to achieve these goals.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We need dedicated engineers to burn down risk and improve reliability in our system like their life depends on it, because others' lives do. Electronics are where software meets the physical world, and so our electrical engineering team has a wide array of engineering skills and works with a variety of different teams. We need people who are comfortable working in different domains, thrive when working on a problem as part of a small group, and are able to communicate technical concepts clearly to a wide variety of stakeholders--software and mechanical engineers, hardware test and manufacturing, and operations and field support, to name a few. Our small team can get a lot done because our team members are strong individual contributors with a good grasp of electrical engineering fundamentals and the ability to define requirements for their systems, rapidly develop creative and simple solutions, and prove with testing that their work meets the rigors and edge-cases of real-world deployment.</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>What You'll Do</strong></h3>\n<p>You'll have your own projects but we haven't been saving an \"intern project\" - you'll be a full member of our team, and like with our other engineers, we'll work with you to find projects that align with your goals and interests and the team's and company's priorities.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of previous projects included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Troubleshooting critical reliability problems on deployed hardware to ensure we can continue to serve patients</li>\n<li>Designing functional testers for our manufacturing floor, which today verify that every part that leaves our factory is ready to work for the people we serve</li>\n<li>Prototyping new versions of our battery charging electronics to meet harsher environmental requirements in new countries where we're launching our service</li>\n<li>Designing and building a custom server rack to simulate tens of thousands of deliveries and validate our flight software on real hardware</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What You'll Bring</strong></h3><h3><strong>The part of your application we're most interested in is \"prior engineering experience,\" somewhat broadly defined. We would like the following three things to be true:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You've designing and tested a custom circuit board (it doesn't need to have worked - we'd love to hear about it!)</li>\n<li>You've worked on a project in or out of school that moved under its own power (plane, car, boat, quadcopter, rocket, balloon, rocket on a balloon, submarine, rover, etc. -- we're not picky)</li>\n<li>You've collaborated on the above two things as part of a group -- school club, competition team, as part of a job/internship, or just with friends</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In your application, we'd love to see either a sample of work you're proud of or a short note about your prior experience and how it relates to the three points above.</p>\n<h3><strong>What Else You Need to Know</strong></h3>\n<p>Zipline is an equal opportunity employer and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws or our own sensibilities.</p>\n\n<p>We value diversity at Zipline and welcome applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech. If you like the sound of this position but are not sure if you are the perfect fit, please apply!</p>\n\n<p>If you'd like to learn more about Zipline and our teams, feel free to check out:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/zipline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.instagram.com/zipline/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/bzs33r/we_are_engineers_and_operators_from_zipline_the/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/bzs33r/we<u>are</u>engineers<u>and</u>operators<u>from</u>zipline_the/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEbRVNxL44c&amp;ab_channel=RealEngineering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEbRVNxL44c&amp;ab_channel=RealEngineering</a></p>",

Most importantly, W3LL makes our community healthier, happier, and more hopeful. </p>\n\n<p>We are an early stage startup with lots of hats to wear. W3LL wants to give a voice to the senior community. Our thesis: When you share your voice, your experiences, your perspectives - it helps us all see each other in ourselves or see ourselves in each other. It is healing. It is educational. It is something that connects us all. W3LL is building a community platform that will collect the stories of older adults/seniors and turn them into podcasts. We are seeking a design/development intern to support the following.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Community Building - We are following the “Build In The Open (BitO)” framework to build a senior community around sharing insights, wisdoms, and perspectives. We want our community to tell us what questions they want to be asked, and how they want to share (short 2 min clips, longer podcast, conversations). </li>\n<li>Content Creator - Collect insights, wisdoms, perspectives from the AgeW3LL community. Create long and short form audio to share on the AgeW3ll platform and social channels. </li>\n<li>Story Teller - Find the narratives. Craft the story arcs.

What are they most excited about post Covid? This is just the beginning.</li>\n<li>LA/Berkeley based - preferred. Virtual internship - Ok.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>W3LL is building a wellbeing exploration and discovery platform for seniors. We feel that giving a voice to older adults is a great place to begin! In the last 11 months, we have run 2 senior discovery cohorts, meet with seniors and B2B partners and we have learned a lot. seniors want easy to find, easy to access, easy to use low tech + no tech solutions. Most importantly, they want a community that listens and values what they have to say. </p>\n\n<p>We are looking for our 2021 team! We are looking for candidates that want to change the world, and improve access to wellbeing/mental health resources. People with interests in positive psychology, neuroscience,and in transformative technology. </p>\n\n<p>What will you get working with W3LL?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Opportunity: Experience working with emerging Transformative Technologies. </li>\n<li>Visionary Product: Be part of the team that is building a marketplace that changes lives.<br></li>\n<li>Access: W3LL is working with a visionary group of transformative technology thinkers, innovators, entrepreneurs, and artists who want to change the world. </li>\n<li>Training: Opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects (AI/ML, data analytics, product development, biz development, and social media/marketing).</li>\n<li>References/Recommendation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please include your resume, and tell us what makes you unique!

This is a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a promising startup with a tangible offering and an app that is already built out but needs significant improvements and continual work to improve the tech. </p>\n\n<p>Current app overview: GymHop is an app that offers a map of gyms to the user along with gym information, allows the user to check in &amp; work out based on proximity to gym location, includes user profiles/editing, and subscription payments with Stripe API/ApplePay/GooglePay. Please note the app is already built but could use considerable upgrades both in UX/UI and additional features.

We have built an application which streamlines the process of sharing and receiving recommendations, very much similar to the way in which Venmo created a platform to send and receive money. Think of and information or recommendation bank; Scatter is that bank. Within the Scatter app users can request and send recommendations for both the physical and non-physical world. For recommendations based in the physical world, they are categorized, subcategorized and plotted on the map portion of the application. The user then accumulates and creates a map of their own personally curated locations around the globe; the user can then share this map or any of the individual map pins with anyone in their trusted network. For recommendations of the non-physical world, the app categorizes, and subcategories the information within the users personal profile. Some categories might be podcasts to listen to, books to read, or shows to watch. Further, recommendations in the non-physical world would revolve around how to do something, how to prepare something, or what to purchase. The technology we have created provides a tool which users can use to sift through and classify the infinite amounts of information that exists in our world. Each user's Scatter profile will be a personal, unique, and extremely valuable compilation of all information that is valuable to that individual. We believe that Scatter will revolutionize not only travel and social media, but the way that we exchange information as a human species.</p>\n\n<p>We are launching on the App Store soon and are looking for a Front-End Engineer who has experience working with mobile frameworks to help the front end design and work alongside the Back End Engineer to make sure the app runs smoothly.<br>\nThis role would be great for someone looking to gain real, strong first-hand experience working on a soon-to-ship app or somebody fresh out of a coding bootcamp eager to learn. </p>\n\n<p>Ideally you have: <br>\n0-2 years’ experience working on projects<br>\nExperience working with React/React Native <br>\nSome understanding of TypeScript or are keen to learn<br>\nSome understanding of GraphQl or keen to learn<br>\nUnderstand git workflow and push/pull requests<br>\nHave used Figma before to design / work from <br>\nShipping an app to the App Store would be a huge bonus!</p>",

Millions of baby-boomers are retiring and are facing a tough problem of enjoying their retirement without running out of money. Our digital platform tailors a personalized drawdown strategy for them and assists them to stick by it. By addressing the unique financial circumstances of retirees, PaceIt is poised to become the one-stop solution for all the boomers’ financial needs. </p>\n\n<p>We are four founders with many years of combined experience in the retirement space.  We have been helping individuals accumulate for retirement and have realized that there is no good solution to guide them through withdrawals once those individuals retire. We are leveraging our experience and wide network with retirement plan providers and record keepers to distribute our solution. We have already signed a major 401(k) record keeper as our launch partner. We are now focused on building our core team towards a launch of our MVP in 2021. The company is well funded to achieve that goal. </p>\n\n<p>We’re currently looking for a phenomenal financial engineer with data science capabilities for an unpaid internship starting on June 21, 2021. The internship will allow you to grow and to take part in a multi-disciplinary development effort. Two of the founders are UCLA professors with many years of experience coaching graduate students. </p>\n\n<p>Example of the tasks that you might be asked to complete:<br>\n• Develop Monte Carlo simulations for modeling retirement portfolios.<br>\n• Use machine learning algorithms to improve portfolio modeling. <br>\n• Analyze transaction data and develop algorithms for tracking individuals spending versus their budgets. <br>\n• Develop machine learning algorithm to predict life expectancy and spending patterns of retirees.</p>\n\n<p>Requirements:<br>\n• Previous work in a start-up and/or hi-tech environment is a plus.<br>\n• Experience modeling investment risk and return using Monte Carlo simulations.<br>\n• Experience using statistical computer languages (mostly Python) to manipulate data and draw insights from large data sets.<br>\n• Knowledge of a variety of machine learning techniques (clustering, tree-based techniques, artificial neural networks, etc.) and their real-world advantages/drawbacks. Familiarity with Tensor flow and Keras is a plus. <br>\n• Knowledge of advanced statistical techniques and concepts (regression, properties of distributions, statistical tests and proper usage, etc.) and experience with applications.<br>\n• A drive to learn and master new technologies and techniques.<br>\n• Previous experience with cloud technology (AWS in particular) is an advantage. </p>\n\n<p>This is a rare opportunity to take part in a high-growth venture at an early stage and help build a company with an important mission. If you want to do good and do well, help us create a needed financial solution for the many baby boomers retiring every day.</p>",

Details fall through the cracks, generic printouts you receive end up in the trash, and important information never makes it to other doctors. Ultimately, you’re left needing to connect the dots in your care. That’s why we started Abridge with a simple thesis: if we can shift agency to consumers, we can help them stay on top of their health. When you use Abridge to record your health conversations, the conversations themselves become your medical record. It’s as easy as that.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for research interns to working on exciting NLP challenges using our large annotated proprietary healthcare datasets. You will be able to create/customize your internship research statement and collaborate with our in-house Machine Learning research team. At the end of the internship, you will also have the opportunity to publish your work at top tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, NAACL, and ACL. </p>\n\n<p>The goal of the internship is to advance the state-of-the-art in one or many of the following research areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dialog Understanding </li>\n<li>Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling</li>\n<li>Clinical Natural Language Processing</li>\n<li>Information Extraction</li>\n<li>Machine Learning using Ontologies or Knowledge graphs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Required Qualification:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Must be accepted to or currently enrolled in an MS or Ph.D. program in Computer Science or a related field</li>\n<li>Must have at least one NLP machine learning paper submitted or published </li>\n<li>Experience in utilizing theoretical and empirical research to solve problems</li>\n<li>Ability to communicate complex research ideas in a clear, precise, and actionable manner</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*Research internships are offered year-round with flexible durations</p>\n\n<p>Compensation</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$80,000-$100,000 per year</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Life at Abridge</p>\n\n<p>At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.</p>\n\n<p>Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and believe that \"you need to taste good things to have good taste.\"</p>\n\n<p>Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).</p>",

The following are three area</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Contribute to the OpenFin UI Library—architect and build accessible, extensible, and well-tested React components used in several OpenFin products shipping this year.</li>\n<li>Help shape the OpenFin Developer Experience—build out automation and testing, documentation, prototypes, and give tech talks. Help optimize and build engineering processes and community knowledge product engineering teams working with the UI Library.</li>\n<li>Contribute to building new features—deliver a best-in-class user experience in OpenFin products.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What We’re Looking For</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A user-focused, empathetic person who wants to collaborate, write, talk, and dream about code that people will love to use.</li>\n<li>Comfortable building <strong>React</strong> components and a passion for making them pixel perfect.</li>\n<li>Awareness of accessibility best practices, progressive enhancement, the DOM /  Shadow DOM and how React “works” under the hood.</li>\n<li>Familiarity and an interest in using <strong>Typescript</strong>, <strong>Styled Components</strong>, and <strong>Framer Motion</strong>. </li>\n<li>An interest in learning cross-platform development for Mac and Windows using <strong>Electron</strong> and modern tools and frameworks like <strong>Webpack</strong> and <strong>NextJS</strong>.</li>\n<li>It would be very cool if you’re opinionated / excited about well-tested frontend code (<strong>Jest</strong>, <strong>Enzyme</strong>, <strong>React Testing Library</strong>), automation, or other aspects of frontend ops—the force multipliers that make other engineers love working together.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A few of our Product Engineering values</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Code with Empathy</strong>—write your code thinking about the person who might use it next, that person might be you ;)</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t follow the GPS into the lake</strong>—be intuitive and critical, be human when you work, especially when taking an empirical point of view.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t take all of the blame</strong>—when software breaks, we’re all on the hook. Another way to say this is there are no gatekeepers.

To that end, the GoodRun mission is to advance basketball culture by digitizing the ecosystem of basketball-related activities and transactions. </p>\n\n<p>Today, GoodRun is a platform to help users find competitive pickup basketball games in their city.

With every industry going through an omnichannel revolution with different competitors on every front, Excel is starting to be really behind the curve to manage and optimize pricing. That’s were we come in with a solution that allows our customer to obtain huge revenue and productivity gains through better price management.</p>\n\n<p>Pricemoov develops revenue optimisation strategies for marketplaces, retail, rental and corporate clients.

You’ll be also creating a QA testing framework so that the team can write and run automated tests in a predefined environment. You will be involved in identifying and fixing bugs, documenting our research platform, and providing support to the Research team in using the research platform.</p>\n\n<p>We've not set it in stone, however our preferred salary range for this  position is $17-28 per hour, depending on experience and background. </p>\n\n<p>THE TEAM<br>\n You’ll join a small but growing software team where everyone—including you—is striving to constantly improve their knowledge of infrastructure, systems, and cares about creating dependable products.
