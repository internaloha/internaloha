At Zipline you will use drones to deliver critical and lifesaving medicine to thousands of hospitals serving millions of people in multiple countries. Our mission is to provide every human on Earth with instant access to vital medical supplies. Join Zipline and help us make this a reality for billions of people.</div>\n<br>\n<div>\n<h3><strong>About You and The Role</strong> </h3><br><br>As a member of the Embedded Systems team at Zipline, you will go deep in your area of ownership, becoming an expert in the problem domain, defining requirements for systems, rapidly developing creative and simple solutions, and proving with testing and data that the system meets the rigors and edge-cases of real-world deployment. Embedded Systems engineers also contribute beyond their field--reviewing schematics, building user interfaces, designing hardware in the loop test systems, and more.\n<br><br>\nZipline designs and operates the world's largest drone delivery service providing access to critical medical supplies. Leading the way in drone delivery often means exceeding the capabilities of what's available off the shelf and as a result we are engineering the majority of our system in-house. Doubling down on the reliability of our systems and inventing new robots is a critical path to delivering to our next billion customers--people whose lives will be meaningfully affected by smarter, more equitable access. We are deliberately expanding our embedded systems capabilities and adding to the ranks of our experienced team to achieve these goals.\n<br><br>\n<h3>What You'll Do</h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You'll work hands-on prototyping novel delivery aircraft systems. Your team will be iterating rapidly to test ideas around aerodynamics, controls, and delivery for our next generation aircraft.</li>\n<li>You'll develop software to run missions, interface with sensors and actuators, compute trajectories, profile mechanical systems, control dynamic systems, and more.</li>\n<li>You'll test your software on real aircraft at our secret test site, and work alongside mechanical and control systems engineers to identify and fix problems in a cross-disciplinary setting.</li>\n<li>You'll use and modify custom simulation tools to design and de-risk flight test plans ahead of time.</li>\n<li>You will be mentored by a world-class embedded systems engineer committed to your learning and growth</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h3>What You'll Bring</h3><br><br><strong>Please complete this required challenge to apply:</strong> https://flyzipline.app.box.com/s/scnx6p86h1a6oevuqnpgdlyux8f1cp7z\n<br><br>\nWe think this game will be a fun but unbiased, execution-focused (vs resume-focused) way of seeing if we're all a match for each other. See here for a <em><strong>sneak peak</strong></em> at what the game looks like: https://youtu.be/xPJ420mRD64 (you can fly a drone, drop packages, recover the aircraft, etc.!)\n<br><br>\nWhat else?:\n\n<ul>\n<li>You've designed, built and deployed electromechanical systems and robots way outside the classroom. Previous interns have built submarines, solar cars in the Australian outback, electric boats, rockets, etc.</li>\n<li>You're comfortable working in C, C++, and Python, and have developed software for a real time operating system or embedded linux.</li>\n<li>You have a basic understanding of kinematics and dynamics, and can use matrices to work with rotations, transformations, and trajectories.</li>\n<li>You can work independently taking ownership of projects with ambiguous requirements.</li>\n<li>Bonus: Experience with the Robot Operating System (ROS), Docker and/or Julia.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Reminder to complete the challenge here and submit the link to your solution to apply:</strong>\n<br><br>\nhttps://flyzipline.app.box.com/s/scnx6p86h1a6oevuqnpgdlyux8f1cp7z\n<br><br>\nNOTE: Applications that do not include a solution to this challenge will not be considered.

Test the system with unit tests and in HITL. Deploy it to all aircraft and ground systems in Rwanda, Ghana and the U.S. Build data analysis tools to check data across the fleet. Use this data to root cause tricky failures that improve the reliability of our fleet so that patients get life saving medical products when they need them</li>\n<li>Rapidly iterate on the concepts for a new perception system, integrating compute modules and sensor prototypes to fly a proof of concept ASAP and de-risk key aspects of the approach.</li>\n<li>Build a system to multiplex batteries between chargers, reducing charging times and operator fatigue. Iterate on the design and user interface with the engineering and operations team, traveling to our test site in Davis with a mocked up user interface to get feedback. Deploy the system into the field, allowing us to finally serve hospitals that have been waiting for medical products.</li>\n<li>Immediately respond to, reproduce and root cause failures so that everyone can get their medical products when they need them</li>\n<li>Find ways to make the codebase better for other engineers through every feature built, for example removing tech debt or cruft, adding debugging or logging tools, increasing test coverage, improving toolchains or build times, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What Else You Need to Know</h3> \n<br>\n<div>Zipline is an equal opportunity employer and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws or our own sensibilities.</div>\n<br>\n<div>We value diversity at Zipline and welcome applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech.

L’Oréal, Staples, Mastercard, and other leading innovators use Ironclad to collaborate and negotiate on contracts, accelerate contracting while maintaining compliance, and turn contracts into critical carriers of operational business intelligence. It’s the only platform flexible enough to handle every type of contract workflow, whether a sales agreement, an HR agreement or a complex NDA. The company was named one of the 20 Rising Stars on the Forbes 2019 Cloud 100 list, and is backed by leading investors like Accel, Y Combinator, Sequoia, and Bond. For more information, visit www.ironcladapp.com or follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.</p><p>Contracts are the atomic unit of business - everything important that a company does involves a contract: sales, purchases, hires, everything. The process for making a contract happen isn’t that different from the software lifecycle: a cross functional group collaborates on a technical document that essentially needs to be executable - just in a courtroom instead of a computer. Most legal teams are still stuck doing things manually, emailing versions of these documents around seeking approval and revisions with no easy way to automate workflows. Simple questions like “what is blocking this contract?” can be really difficult to answer since the information is locked in someone’s inbox.</p><p>As an Engineering Intern, you'll be working across the team to identify business problems and design, build and verify solutions. You'll be building a platform that lets lawyers scale themselves 100x more effectively. This is a chance to bring a two thousand year old profession into the digital age and ship a product to paying users that can’t live without. Real projects, impactful work, supportive team!</p><p><b>What we're looking for: </b></p><ul><li>A driven engineer excited to build and ship products</li><li>Passion for learning and sharing knowledge</li><li>Experience with high quality engineering standards</li><li>Desire to work cross functionally coming up with product solutions (experience in legal space not required)</li><li>Currently enrolled in Bachelors or Masters program studying Computer Science or related field, or equivalent technical experience</li></ul><p><b>What you'll do: </b></p><ul><li>Collaborate with designers, product managers, and other engineers to spec, design, and build features and systems</li><li>Pair with a mentor whose #1 goal is to help you ramp onto our technology, product, and team</li><li>Work with quality engineers to define, build and maintain testing strategy</li><li>Be a part of a talented and collaborative team passionate about using the most effective tools to solve real problems</li><li>Provide thoughtful feedback to others on the team</li><li>Work on a modern stack built upon: TypeScript, ReactJS, Node.js, Java, and Docker containers in Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform (experience with these specific technologies not required)</li></ul><p>Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.</p><p>Job Type: Internship</p>",
