We are working to address critical challenges that the world must overcome this decade in order to secure a sustainable future for people and the planet: climate change, energy, food, forests, water, sustainable cities, and the ocean.<br><br>Internships at WRI are learning experiences designed for current students, recent graduates, and other candidates who wish to gain knowledge about a specific area of our work. We strive to attract diverse, intellectually driven candidates who have a passion for sustainability and development. WRI provides many internship opportunities throughout the year in all our programs.<br><br>WRI is committed to advancing gender, racial, and social equity for human well-being in our mission and applies this principle to our organizational and programmatic practices.<br><br><br><b>Program Overview</b><br><br>Science Based Targets is a joint initiative by CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and WWF, in collaboration with the We Mean Business Coalition, intended to increase ambition on corporate climate action by driving the adoption of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with what the latest climate science says is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Through the SBTi Finance project, SBTi is also working with financial institutions to set portfolio-level SBTs and formally validating the targets that meet the initiative’s criteria. The aim of the project is for portfolio-level SBTs to become standard practice and for these targets to result in emissions reductions in the real economy. The project intends to raise the ambition of the finance sector by defining and promoting best practice in science-based target setting and providing methods, criteria, guidance and tools to reduce the barriers to adoption and implementation (i.e. actions that lead to atmospheric reductions of GHG concentrations). Within the broad ecosystem of organizations and value chains that link financial institutions with GHG emissions in the real economy, the SBTi Finance project is focused on ex ante targets at the asset-class level. The first version of the target setting framework for financial institutions was launched in October 2020 and will be updated on an annual basis as our understanding of how financial institutions can achieve emissions reductions in the real economy evolves.<br><br><b>Internship Summary</b><br><br>This position represents a unique opportunity to support one of WRI’s high impact initiatives to increase the ambition of financial institutions to set targets that lead to GHG emissions reductions in the real economy.

You will serve in a coordinating role for the SBTi Finance target setting framework team, helping to manage and ramp up the capacity of projects to develop various new resources with an emphasis on outreach and communications.

We are working to address critical challenges that the world must overcome this decade in order to secure a sustainable future for people and the planet: climate change, energy, food, forests, water, sustainable cities, and the ocean.<br><br>Internships at WRI are learning experiences designed for current students, recent graduates, and other candidates who wish to gain knowledge about a specific area of our work. We strive to attract diverse, intellectually driven candidates who have a passion for sustainability and development. WRI provides many internship opportunities throughout the year in all our programs.<br><br>WRI is committed to advancing gender, racial, and social equity for human well-being in our mission and applies this principle to our organizational and programmatic practices.<br><br><br><b>Program Overview</b><br><br>Science Based Targets is a joint initiative by CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and WWF, in collaboration with the We Mean Business Coalition, intended to increase ambition on corporate climate action by driving the adoption of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with what the latest climate science says is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Through the SBTi Finance project, SBTi is also working with financial institutions to set portfolio-level SBTs and formally validating the targets that meet the initiative’s criteria. The aim of the project is for portfolio-level SBTs to become standard practice and for these targets to result in emissions reductions in the real economy. The project intends to raise the ambition of the finance sector by defining and promoting best practice in science-based target setting and providing methods, criteria, guidance and tools to reduce the barriers to adoption and implementation (i.e. actions that lead to atmospheric reductions of GHG concentrations). Within the broad ecosystem of organizations and value chains that link financial institutions with GHG emissions in the real economy, the SBTi Finance project is focused on ex ante targets at the asset-class level. The first version of the target setting framework for financial institutions was launched in October 2020 and will be updated on an annual basis as our understanding of how financial institutions can achieve emissions reductions in the real economy evolves.<br><br><b>Internship Summary</b><br><br>This position represents a unique opportunity to support one of WRI’s high impact initiatives to increase the ambition of financial institutions to set targets that lead to GHG emissions reductions in the real economy.

You will serve in a coordinating role for the SBTi Finance target setting framework team, helping to manage and ramp up the capacity of projects to develop various new resources with an emphasis on outreach and communications.

Through the SBTi Finance project, SBTi is also working with financial institutions to set portfolio-level SBTs and formally validating the targets that meet the initiative’s criteria. The aim of the project is for portfolio-level SBTs to become standard practice and for these targets to result in emissions reductions in the real economy. The project intends to raise the ambition of the finance sector by defining and promoting best practice in science-based target setting and providing methods, criteria, guidance and tools to reduce the barriers to adoption and implementation (i.e. actions that lead to atmospheric reductions of GHG concentrations). Within the broad ecosystem of organizations and value chains that link financial institutions with GHG emissions in the real economy, the SBTi Finance project is focused on ex ante targets at the asset-class level. The first version of the target setting framework for financial institutions was launched in October 2020 and will be updated on an annual basis as our understanding of how financial institutions can achieve emissions reductions in the real economy evolves.<br><br><b>Internship Summary</b><br><br>This position represents a unique opportunity to support one of WRI’s high impact initiatives to increase the ambition of financial institutions to set targets that lead to GHG emissions reductions in the real economy.

The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.<br><br>Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.
