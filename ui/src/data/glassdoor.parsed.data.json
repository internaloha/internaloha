Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines, to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.</div><div></div><div><br>The Microsoft Research Computational Social Science (CSS) group is widely recognized as a leading center of CSS research, lying at the intersection of computer science, statistics and the social sciences. Our approach is motivated by two longstanding difficulties for traditional social science: first, that simply gathering observational data on human activity is extremely difficult at scale and over time; and second, that running experiments to manipulate the conditions under which these measurements are made (e.g., randomly assigning large sets of interacting people to treatment and control groups) is even more challenging and often impossible.</div><div></div><div><br>In the first category, we exploit digital data that is generated by existing platforms (e.g., email, web browsers, search, social media) to generate novel insights into individual and collective human behavior. In the second category, we design novel “virtual lab” experiments that allow for larger scale, longer time horizons, and greater complexity and realism than is possible in physical labs.</div><h2><b>Responsibilities</b></h2><div>Interns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world’s best researchers, interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides.

Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.</div><h2><b>Qualifications</b></h2><div>In addition to the qualifications below, you’ll need to submit a minimum of two reference letters for this position.

The research activities span the continuum from basic animal research to clinical protocols involving both healthy humans and patients. Areas of research include hemorrhage control, resuscitation, burn, triage, extremity injury, pain, assessment of injury severity, directed energy, and design and testing of new methods, agents, and devices to treat combat-related injuries.</p><p>The project is in the area of the physiology of human hemorrhage and compensation. Hemorrhagic shock is the leading cause of death on the battlefield. The Battlefield Health &amp; Trauma (BHT) Center for Human Integrated Physiology (CHIP) has the only experimental model for the study of human hemorrhage in the Department of Defense (DoD). The Tri-Service Research Laboratory (TSRL) has the only DoD experimental model of poly-trauma in the genetically-closest surrogate to humans using non-human primates (NHP) that combines hemorrhage and tissue trauma similar to that experienced by our injured warfighters on the battlefield. As a result of the extensive databases generated from the collaborative efforts of these laboratories that employ both human and NHP experiments, there exists a requirement to assign an individual to provide support to data archiving and analysis. In this regard, the participant will organize experimental data into a user-friendly registry based in Microsoft Excel for use by numerous investigators at the USAISR and NAMRU-SA who might be interested in testing hypotheses regarding the physiology and pathophysiology of blood loss and low blood flow states without having to repeat experimentation. The defined project activities will include participant collaboration with and instruction from leading scientists, engineers, and data managers actively conducting combat casualty care research. This experience will provide the participant with the unique educational exposure that demonstrates the execution of high-level science (i.e., how to approach the performance of rigorous scientific method) with hands-on experiences of data collection and analysis that can lead to changes in medical care of critically ill or injured patients. The research activities defined by this project will provide the participant with new insights into the common pathways in which Army and Navy biomedical research meet the military medical mission of 'optimizing combat casualty care' and advancing civilian medicine.</p><p><b>Appointment Length</b></p><p>This appointment is a twelve month research appointment, with the possibility to be renewed for additional research periods. Appointments may be extended depending on funding availability, project assignment, program rules, and availability of the participant.</p><p><b>Participant Benefits</b></p><p>Participants will receive a stipend to be determined by <b>USAISR</b>. Stipends are typically based on the participant’s academic standing, discipline, experience, and research facility location. Other benefits may include the following:</p><ul><li><p>Health Insurance Supplement. Participants are eligible to purchase health insurance through ORISE.</p></li><li><p>Relocation Allowance</p></li><li><p>Training and Travel Allowance</p></li></ul><p><b>Nature of Appointment</b></p><p>The participant will not enter into an employee/employer relationship with ORISE, ORAU, DOD, or any other office or agency. Instead, the participant will be affiliated with ORISE for the administration of the appointment through the ORISE appointment letter and Terms of Appointment.</p></div></div><div><div><b>Qualifications</b></div><div><p>The candidate should be an undergraduate student currently pursuing a baccalaureate degree. Proficiency with the use of Microsoft programs, particularly Excel, Power Point, and Word, will be required. Since the position will require analyzing data related to the physiology of human hemorrhage and compensation for 'optimizing combat casualty care', field experience in combat medic training is highly desired.</p></div></div><div><div><b>Eligibility Requirements</b></div><div><ul><li><b>Citizenship: </b>U.S. Citizen Only</li><li><b>Degree:</b> Currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree.</li><li><b>Discipline(s):</b><ul><li><b>Communications and Graphics Design</b></li><li><b>Computer, Information, and Data Sciences</b></li><li><b>Earth and Geosciences</b></li><li><b>Engineering</b></li><li><b>Environmental and Marine Sciences</b></li><li><b>Life Health and Medical Sciences</b></li><li><b>Mathematics and Statistics</b></li><li><b>Nanotechnology</b></li><li><b>Other Non-S&amp;E</b></li><li><b>Other Physical Sciences</b></li><li><b>Physics</b></li><li><b>Social and Behavioral Sciences</b></li></ul></li><li><b>Veteran Status:</b> Veterans Preference, degree received within the last 120 month(s).</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>",
