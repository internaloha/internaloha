We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

This turns out to be a process that can be efficiently simulated by a deep neural network.

You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code - and how to think like a coder - and be rewarded with an amazing experience. This is a part-time position for anywhere from 6-20 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule and availability. These hours can generally be sometime between 3-8pm weekdays or 10-3pm on Saturday's.</b></p><p><b>Responsibilities: </b></p><p><b>A Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code. At theCoderSchool, we have three basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.</b></p><p><b>1. Code Coaching - Private and Semi-Private Tutoring. One-on-one or one-on-two coding lessons for kids. Younger kids will be taught in Scratch or Snap, while older kids gravitate towards Python/Javascript or other advanced languages like Java, C++. The kids will generally create apps that you decide with them, and generally follow our curriculums.</b></p><p><b>2. Code Coaching PLUS. Our more experienced Code Coaches will manage a team of kids who will collaborate to create a complex app together. Requirements, design, iterations - similar to a real development but with more fun team challenges and activities mixed in.</b></p><p><b>3. Code Class. Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio, where all students follow a set specific curriculum.</b></p><p><b>This position rocks because you will: </b></p><p><b> * Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to be our next generation of coders!</b></p><p><b> * Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the Atlanta area.</b></p><p><b> * Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology</b></p><p><b> * Have the flexibility to teach what you're most comfortable with, and learn new things along the way</b></p><p><b>Requirements: </b></p><p><b>What do we want from you? Read on.</b></p><p><b> * PASSION. All caps! This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge.</b></p><p><b> * Great Communicator. There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids!</b></p><p><b> * Street Cred. Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school. Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience.</b></p><p><b> * Coding Skills. Strong grasp of general technologies, proficient coder and uber-logical thinker. General knowledge of popular languages with hands on skills in a few is required - Javascript, Python, HTML/CSS, Java, C++ are most helpful.

        "description": "<div>The selected intern will support and run high performance computing software in a research and development environment. The position requires full-time commitment for summer 2021 and, depending on needs and the candidate’s skills and interest, may extend into the fall semester as a part-time position. Computational simulations are routinely performed to develop or improve TEL’s technology equipment and chemical/physical processes. The candidate should have strong interest in physics or chemistry, as well as experience in programming, understanding, and running scientific software. In most cases, the candidate will work with the software’s source codes written in C/C++ and Python. He/she will compile those codes on Linux, understand how they work based on documentation as well as on the source code itself, run them, and visualize the results. We will try to accommodate personal interests of the candidate to a particular area of research and simulations, be that atomistic molecular dynamics simulations such, for example, as with the LAMMPS code, or fluid-type simulations such as with openFoam, or plasma simulations, or kinetic Monte Carlo Particle-In-Cell simulations. Most of the codes are strongly parallelized for the multi-CPU environment, and correspondingly, the candidate should have some knowledge of OpenMPI and OpenMP to understand how the codes are functioning. The candidate will also assist with some of the fundamental scientific research and conduct technical searches in peer review journals.\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul><li>This internship is payrolled via a payroll processing company.</li></ul><br>\nResponsibilities:\n<br>\n<ul><li>Work independently (or with limited guidance) with the assigned complex scientific software.\n</li><li>Compile the software in Linux environment, including the current HPC environment.\n</li><li>Understand the software and the computational methods used in it.\n</li><li>Prepare input files and run particular cases of interest.\n</li><li>When needed, write shell scripts, or C/C++/Python routines to improve the software or add new capabilities.\n</li><li>Develop and maintain user manuals and guidelines.\n</li><li>Train end users to any changes in code or operational procedures.\n</li><li>Write reports documenting everything learned and all results obtained.\n</li><li>Assist in conducting basic research.\n</li></ul><br>\nQualifications:\n<br>\n<ul><li>Experienced with Linux/Unix operating systems.\n</li><li>Pursuing BS or advanced degree in physics, chemistry, engineering or computer science fields.\n</li><li>Must be authorized to work in the U.S. without sponsorship.</li><li>Experienced in C/C++/Python programming languages.\n</li><li>Good written, oral, and interpersonal communication skills.\n</li><li>Capable of working both independently and in a team-oriented, collaborative environment.\n</li><li>Sitting for extended periods of time.\n</li></ul><br>\nEqual Opportunity Employer/Minorities/Females/Disabled/Veterans</div>",

Learn to Code, Change the World.</b></p><p><b>Job Summary: </b></p><p><b>**** We’ve found that some students are only comfortable taking sessions in-person so the applicant will need to be able to come into our school to teach as well as online. We’re taking all necessary safety precautions during this time of Covid-19! ****</b></p><p><b>theCoderSchool is looking for passionate Code Coach Interns to teach our next generation how to change the world! You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code - and how to think like a coder - and be rewarded with an amazing experience.

These hours can generally be sometime between 3-8pm weekdays or 10-3pm on Saturday's.</b></p><p><b>Responsibilities: </b></p><p><b>A Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code. At theCoderSchool, we have three basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.</b></p><p><b>1. Code Coaching - Private and Semi-Private Tutoring. One-on-one or one-on-two coding lessons for kids. Younger kids will be taught in Scratch or Snap, while older kids gravitate towards Python/Javascript or other advanced languages like Java, C++. The kids will generally create apps that you decide with them, and generally follow our curriculums.</b></p><p><b>2. Code Coaching PLUS. Our more experienced Code Coaches will manage a team of kids who will collaborate to create a complex app together. Requirements, design, iterations - similar to a real development but with more fun team challenges and activities mixed in.</b></p><p><b>3. Code Class. Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio, where all students follow a set specific curriculum.</b></p><p><b>This position rocks because you will: </b></p><p><b> * Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to be our next generation of coders!</b></p><p><b> * Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the Atlanta area.</b></p><p><b> * Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology</b></p><p><b> * Have the flexibility to teach what you're most comfortable with, and learn new things along the way</b></p><p><b>Requirements: </b></p><p><b>What do we want from you? Read on.</b></p><p><b> * PASSION. All caps! This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge.</b></p><p><b> * Great Communicator. There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids!</b></p><p><b> * Street Cred. Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school. Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience.</b></p><p><b> * Coding Skills. Strong grasp of general technologies, proficient coder and uber-logical thinker. General knowledge of popular languages with hands on skills in a few is required - Javascript, Python, HTML/CSS, Java, C++ are most helpful.

The position requires full-time commitment for summer 2021 and, depending on needs and the candidate’s skills and interest, may extend into the fall semester as a part-time position. Computational simulations are routinely performed to develop or improve TEL’s technology equipment and chemical/physical processes. The candidate should have strong interest in physics or chemistry, as well as experience in programming, understanding, and running scientific software. In most cases, the candidate will work with the software’s source codes written in C/C++ and Python. He/she will compile those codes on Linux, understand how they work based on documentation as well as on the source code itself, run them, and visualize the results. We will try to accommodate personal interests of the candidate to a particular area of research and simulations, be that atomistic molecular dynamics simulations such, for example, as with the LAMMPS code, or fluid-type simulations such as with openFoam, or plasma simulations, or kinetic Monte Carlo Particle-In-Cell simulations. Most of the codes are strongly parallelized for the multi-CPU environment, and correspondingly, the candidate should have some knowledge of OpenMPI and OpenMP to understand how the codes are functioning.

We’re taking all necessary safety precautions during this time of Covid-19! ****</b></p><p><b>theCoderSchool is looking for passionate Code Coach Interns to teach our next generation how to change the world!

One-on-one or one-on-two coding lessons for kids. Younger kids will be taught in Scratch or Snap, while older kids gravitate towards Python/Javascript or other advanced languages like Java, C++. The kids will generally create apps that you decide with them, and generally follow our curriculums.</b></p><p><b>2. Code Coaching PLUS. Our more experienced Code Coaches will manage a team of kids who will collaborate to create a complex app together. Requirements, design, iterations - similar to a real development but with more fun team challenges and activities mixed in.</b></p><p><b>3. Code Class. Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio, where all students follow a set specific curriculum.</b></p><p><b>This position rocks because you will: </b></p><p><b> * Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to be our next generation of coders!</b></p><p><b> * Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the Atlanta area.</b></p><p><b> * Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology</b></p><p><b> * Have the flexibility to teach what you're most comfortable with, and learn new things along the way</b></p><p><b>Requirements: </b></p><p><b>What do we want from you?

There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids!</b></p><p><b> * Street Cred. Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school. Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience.</b></p><p><b> * Coding Skills. Strong grasp of general technologies, proficient coder and uber-logical thinker.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

The position requires full-time commitment for summer 2021 and, depending on needs and the candidate’s skills and interest, may extend into the fall semester as a part-time position. Computational simulations are routinely performed to develop or improve TEL’s technology equipment and chemical/physical processes. The candidate should have strong interest in physics or chemistry, as well as experience in programming, understanding, and running scientific software. In most cases, the candidate will work with the software’s source codes written in C/C++ and Python. He/she will compile those codes on Linux, understand how they work based on documentation as well as on the source code itself, run them, and visualize the results.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

        "description": "<div><div><b>Open Date: April 28, 2021</b></div>\n<p><b>Close Date: May 14, 2021</b></p>\n<p><b>Program Webpage: </b>http://internships.fnal.gov/fermilab-computational-science-internship/\n</p><p><b>Program Dates: </b>May 24- August 13, 2021</p>\n<p><b>We are:</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab is America’s premier laboratory for particle physics and accelerator research, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

        "description": "<div><div><b>Open Date: April 28, 2021</b></div>\n<p><b>Close Date: May 14, 2021</b></p>\n<p><b>Program Webpage: </b>http://internships.fnal.gov/fermilab-computational-science-internship/\n</p><p><b>Program Dates: </b>May 24- August 13, 2021</p>\n<p><b>We are:</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab is America’s premier laboratory for particle physics and accelerator research, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

        "description": "<div><div><b>Open Date: April 28, 2021</b></div>\n<p><b>Close Date: May 14, 2021</b></p>\n<p><b>Program Webpage: </b>http://internships.fnal.gov/fermilab-computational-science-internship/\n</p><p><b>Program Dates: </b>May 24- August 13, 2021</p>\n<p><b>We are:</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab is America’s premier laboratory for particle physics and accelerator research, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

One idea is that the laws-or the parameters that characterize them, such as the masses of the different quarks and leptons, can evolve in time. Several mechanisms have been proposed, which can be visualized as a point representing the universe moving on a vast landscape of possible laws. This turns out to be a process that can be efficiently simulated by a deep neural network. We continue our work started in 2020 building and running models to investigate this and other ideas about how the universe chose or learnt its laws.
