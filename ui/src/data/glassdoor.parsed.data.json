The selection process (with more details on the 2021 summer assignments) will begin shortly.</em>\n<br><br>\nThe California Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up 80 percent of California's power grid. We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by operating the grid reliably 24/7.\n<br><br>\nAs the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.\n<br><br>\nThe California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others. In the same way, the California ISO operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.<br><br>Job Description<br><br><strong>What's In it for You</strong>\n<br><br>\nOur purpose is to lead the way to tomorrow's energy network.

The selection process (with more details on the 2021 summer assignments) will begin shortly.</em>\n<br><br>\nThe California Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up 80 percent of California's power grid. We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by operating the grid reliably 24/7.\n<br><br>\nAs the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.\n<br><br>\nThe California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others.

At Zipline you will use drones to deliver critical and lifesaving medicine to thousands of hospitals serving millions of people in multiple countries. Our mission is to provide every human on Earth with instant access to vital medical supplies. Join Zipline and help us make this a reality for billions of people.</div>\n<br>\n<div>\n<h3><strong>About You and The Role</strong> </h3><br><br>As a member of the Embedded Systems team at Zipline, you will go deep in your area of ownership, becoming an expert in the problem domain, defining requirements for systems, rapidly developing creative and simple solutions, and proving with testing and data that the system meets the rigors and edge-cases of real-world deployment. Embedded Systems engineers also contribute beyond their field--reviewing schematics, building user interfaces, designing hardware in the loop test systems, and more.\n<br><br>\nZipline designs and operates the world's largest drone delivery service providing access to critical medical supplies. Leading the way in drone delivery often means exceeding the capabilities of what's available off the shelf and as a result we are engineering the majority of our system in-house. Doubling down on the reliability of our systems and inventing new robots is a critical path to delivering to our next billion customers--people whose lives will be meaningfully affected by smarter, more equitable access. We are deliberately expanding our embedded systems capabilities and adding to the ranks of our experienced team to achieve these goals.\n<br><br>\n<h3>What You'll Do</h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You'll work hands-on prototyping novel delivery aircraft systems. Your team will be iterating rapidly to test ideas around aerodynamics, controls, and delivery for our next generation aircraft.</li>\n<li>You'll develop software to run missions, interface with sensors and actuators, compute trajectories, profile mechanical systems, control dynamic systems, and more.</li>\n<li>You'll test your software on real aircraft at our secret test site, and work alongside mechanical and control systems engineers to identify and fix problems in a cross-disciplinary setting.</li>\n<li>You'll use and modify custom simulation tools to design and de-risk flight test plans ahead of time.</li>\n<li>You will be mentored by a world-class embedded systems engineer committed to your learning and growth</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h3>What You'll Bring</h3><br><br><strong>Please complete this required challenge to apply:</strong> https://flyzipline.app.box.com/s/scnx6p86h1a6oevuqnpgdlyux8f1cp7z\n<br><br>\nWe think this game will be a fun but unbiased, execution-focused (vs resume-focused) way of seeing if we're all a match for each other. See here for a <em><strong>sneak peak</strong></em> at what the game looks like: https://youtu.be/xPJ420mRD64 (you can fly a drone, drop packages, recover the aircraft, etc.!)\n<br><br>\nWhat else?:\n\n<ul>\n<li>You've designed, built and deployed electromechanical systems and robots way outside the classroom. Previous interns have built submarines, solar cars in the Australian outback, electric boats, rockets, etc.</li>\n<li>You're comfortable working in C, C++, and Python, and have developed software for a real time operating system or embedded linux.</li>\n<li>You have a basic understanding of kinematics and dynamics, and can use matrices to work with rotations, transformations, and trajectories.</li>\n<li>You can work independently taking ownership of projects with ambiguous requirements.</li>\n<li>Bonus: Experience with the Robot Operating System (ROS), Docker and/or Julia.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Reminder to complete the challenge here and submit the link to your solution to apply:</strong>\n<br><br>\nhttps://flyzipline.app.box.com/s/scnx6p86h1a6oevuqnpgdlyux8f1cp7z\n<br><br>\nNOTE: Applications that do not include a solution to this challenge will not be considered.

Test the system with unit tests and in HITL. Deploy it to all aircraft and ground systems in Rwanda, Ghana and the U.S. Build data analysis tools to check data across the fleet. Use this data to root cause tricky failures that improve the reliability of our fleet so that patients get life saving medical products when they need them</li>\n<li>Rapidly iterate on the concepts for a new perception system, integrating compute modules and sensor prototypes to fly a proof of concept ASAP and de-risk key aspects of the approach.</li>\n<li>Build a system to multiplex batteries between chargers, reducing charging times and operator fatigue. Iterate on the design and user interface with the engineering and operations team, traveling to our test site in Davis with a mocked up user interface to get feedback. Deploy the system into the field, allowing us to finally serve hospitals that have been waiting for medical products.</li>\n<li>Immediately respond to, reproduce and root cause failures so that everyone can get their medical products when they need them</li>\n<li>Find ways to make the codebase better for other engineers through every feature built, for example removing tech debt or cruft, adding debugging or logging tools, increasing test coverage, improving toolchains or build times, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What Else You Need to Know</h3> \n<br>\n<div>Zipline is an equal opportunity employer and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws or our own sensibilities.</div>\n<br>\n<div>We value diversity at Zipline and welcome applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech.

At Zipline you will use drones to deliver critical and lifesaving medicine to thousands of hospitals serving millions of people in multiple countries. Our mission is to provide every human on Earth with instant access to vital medical supplies. Join Zipline and help us make this a reality for billions of people.</div>\n<br>\n<div>\n<h3><strong>About You and The Role</strong> </h3><br><br>As a member of the Embedded Systems team at Zipline, you will go deep in your area of ownership, becoming an expert in the problem domain, defining requirements for systems, rapidly developing creative and simple solutions, and proving with testing and data that the system meets the rigors and edge-cases of real-world deployment. Embedded Systems engineers also contribute beyond their field--reviewing schematics, building user interfaces, designing hardware in the loop test systems, and more.\n<br><br>\nZipline designs and operates the world's largest drone delivery service providing access to critical medical supplies. Leading the way in drone delivery often means exceeding the capabilities of what's available off the shelf and as a result we are engineering the majority of our system in-house. Doubling down on the reliability of our systems and inventing new robots is a critical path to delivering to our next billion customers--people whose lives will be meaningfully affected by smarter, more equitable access. We are deliberately expanding our embedded systems capabilities and adding to the ranks of our experienced team to achieve these goals.\n<br><br>\n<h3>What You'll Do</h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You'll work hands-on prototyping novel delivery aircraft systems. Your team will be iterating rapidly to test ideas around aerodynamics, controls, and delivery for our next generation aircraft.</li>\n<li>You'll develop software to run missions, interface with sensors and actuators, compute trajectories, profile mechanical systems, control dynamic systems, and more.</li>\n<li>You'll test your software on real aircraft at our secret test site, and work alongside mechanical and control systems engineers to identify and fix problems in a cross-disciplinary setting.</li>\n<li>You'll use and modify custom simulation tools to design and de-risk flight test plans ahead of time.</li>\n<li>You will be mentored by a world-class embedded systems engineer committed to your learning and growth</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h3>What You'll Bring</h3><br><br><strong>Please complete this required challenge to apply:</strong> https://flyzipline.app.box.com/s/scnx6p86h1a6oevuqnpgdlyux8f1cp7z\n<br><br>\nWe think this game will be a fun but unbiased, execution-focused (vs resume-focused) way of seeing if we're all a match for each other. See here for a <em><strong>sneak peak</strong></em> at what the game looks like: https://youtu.be/xPJ420mRD64 (you can fly a drone, drop packages, recover the aircraft, etc.!)\n<br><br>\nWhat else?:\n\n<ul>\n<li>You've designed, built and deployed electromechanical systems and robots way outside the classroom. Previous interns have built submarines, solar cars in the Australian outback, electric boats, rockets, etc.</li>\n<li>You're comfortable working in C, C++, and Python, and have developed software for a real time operating system or embedded linux.</li>\n<li>You have a basic understanding of kinematics and dynamics, and can use matrices to work with rotations, transformations, and trajectories.</li>\n<li>You can work independently taking ownership of projects with ambiguous requirements.</li>\n<li>Bonus: Experience with the Robot Operating System (ROS), Docker and/or Julia.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Reminder to complete the challenge here and submit the link to your solution to apply:</strong>\n<br><br>\nhttps://flyzipline.app.box.com/s/scnx6p86h1a6oevuqnpgdlyux8f1cp7z\n<br><br>\nNOTE: Applications that do not include a solution to this challenge will not be considered.

Test the system with unit tests and in HITL. Deploy it to all aircraft and ground systems in Rwanda, Ghana and the U.S. Build data analysis tools to check data across the fleet. Use this data to root cause tricky failures that improve the reliability of our fleet so that patients get life saving medical products when they need them</li>\n<li>Rapidly iterate on the concepts for a new perception system, integrating compute modules and sensor prototypes to fly a proof of concept ASAP and de-risk key aspects of the approach.</li>\n<li>Build a system to multiplex batteries between chargers, reducing charging times and operator fatigue. Iterate on the design and user interface with the engineering and operations team, traveling to our test site in Davis with a mocked up user interface to get feedback. Deploy the system into the field, allowing us to finally serve hospitals that have been waiting for medical products.</li>\n<li>Immediately respond to, reproduce and root cause failures so that everyone can get their medical products when they need them</li>\n<li>Find ways to make the codebase better for other engineers through every feature built, for example removing tech debt or cruft, adding debugging or logging tools, increasing test coverage, improving toolchains or build times, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What Else You Need to Know</h3> \n<br>\n<div>Zipline is an equal opportunity employer and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws or our own sensibilities.</div>\n<br>\n<div>We value diversity at Zipline and welcome applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech.

However, during the current crisis, we are strongly supporting interns working from home using remote access to the personal tutoring and all of the IT technology available to our interns.<br><br>Program hours?<br><br>8 hours a day are mandatory, typically 8am to 5pm.<br><br>Number of days per week?<br><br>Monday through Friday. Additionally, there are supplementary hours for further study on Saturdays, typically attended by more than half the participants working with tutors and on their own projects.<br><br>When do programs start?<br><br>Please see above on the ’Enrollment/Registration’ page for information on upcoming class dates.<br><br>Do I need IT experience?<br><br>No. Our program is designed for participants who lack IT experience—our program is focused on training participants with NO IT experience to a very high level of expertise in 5 months. With that said, even if you have some IT background (a 2 or 4 year degree, without extensive industry experience, for example) we are confident that our program will be beneficial for you.<br><br><b>Program Costs:</b><br>What is the cost of the program?<br><br>$35,000, once you transition into a good paying job.<br><br>We support a Pay for Success model, where you repay the program’s cost only when you are employed with a good salary. You need to be making over $45,000 per year, then you only pay 9% of your salary until you have covered the cost of the program and servicing fees. If your income falls below $45,000, your repayment is suspended. After six years, your commitment ends - even if the cost isn’t fully repaid; this isn’t a loan. And we clearly believe our students are going to be highly successful after they graduate.<br><br><b>Employment and Certification:</b><br>Will I have a job at the end of this program?<br><br>Historically, 40% of participants have transitioned into full-time employment with the end of the program; 70% are employed within 3 months; 98% are employed or have entered a traditional college program at 6 months.<br><br>What sort of job would I be able to get with this course?<br><br>Acuitus prepares students for compelling careers in IT. Our graduates have landed jobs in systems and network administration, technical support, network engineering, systems engineering, sales engineering. Many have landed positions right out of Acuitus in IT Management and senior technical roles, jobs typically taken by IT professionals with five to ten years experience in industry. The variety of employers that have hired Acuitus graduates reflects a wide range of large enterprises, technology providers, regional IT providers, System Integrators as well as startups. The choice of potential employers allows graduates to make the trade-offs they are most comfortable with in terms of specialization, career trajectory, geographic location, corporate culture and other critical factors in choosing a career.<br><br>Is any certification or degree offered as part of the course?<br><br>This program focuses on transforming you into an expert, teaching you the hard ideas, and getting you experience, in short the elements that make advanced certifications hard for most people. Most students complete at least the first half of the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) certification before they graduate and many complete both parts. Other certifications that students have passed during the course include: COMPTIA certifications (such as Linux + and Network+); and, the MCSA (Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate).<br><br>Where will I be working after I graduate?<br><br>Our corporate partners represent a wide range of industries. Some are large enterprises with locations spread across the country and around the world. Some are technology companies with exciting high-growth businesses supplying products and services to large corporations. Others are smaller regional firms that want to hire mature, independent professionals with great IT skills.<br><br>Does Acuitus get a fee if I’m hired by one of your corporate partners?<br><br>No, Acuitus does not receive compensation for placement. Our job is to make sure you are the best IT professional you can be before you graduate and to prepare you to find the best job to meet your needs and your desires. We have no financial stake in who employs you or where you are employed.<br><br>How much will I be making in my new job? Is this only preparing me for an entry-level position?<br><br>We are NOT preparing you for an entry-level job. Your salary level upon graduation depends on a number of factors, including your specific interests in the field of IT, the geographic location in which you choose to seek work, whether you want to work for a small company or a large company, whether you were passionate about IT and the companies you interviewed with. And historically, our graduates have seen an average increase in salary of 14% per year over five years, which is notable.",

Our approach is motivated by two longstanding difficulties for traditional social science: first, that simply gathering observational data on human activity is extremely difficult at scale and over time; and second, that running experiments to manipulate the conditions under which these measurements are made (e.g., randomly assigning large sets of interacting people to treatment and control groups) is even more challenging and often impossible.</div><div></div><br><div>In the first category, we exploit digital data that is generated by existing platforms (e.g., email, web browsers, search, social media) to generate novel insights into individual and collective human behavior. In the second category, we design novel “virtual lab” experiments that allow for larger scale, longer time horizons, and greater complexity and realism than is possible in physical labs.</div><h2><b>Responsibilities</b></h2><div>Interns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world’s best researchers, interns learn, collaborate, and network for life.

Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.</div><h2><b>Qualifications</b></h2><div>In addition to the qualifications below, you’ll need to submit a minimum of two reference letters for this position.

Note that reference letters cannot be requested until after you have submitted your application, and furthermore, that they might not be automatically requested for all candidates. You may wish to alert your letter writers in advance, so they will be ready to submit your letter.</div><h4><b>Required Qualifications</b></h4><ul><li>Must be currently enrolled in a PhD program in a computational social science field.</li><li>Must have at least 1 year of experience designing, building, and analyzing: online experiments and/or large observational data studies.</li><li>Must have two or more years of experience with relevant programming languages such as R and Python for data analysis or modern web development tools (e.g., JavaScript) for online experiments.</li></ul><h4><b>Preferred Qualifications</b></h4><ul><li>Demonstrated ability to develop original research agendas.</li><li>Track record of cross-group and cross-culture collaboration.</li><li>Ability to think unconventionally to derive creative and innovative solutions.</li></ul><div></div><br><div>Microsoft is an equal opportunity employer.

At Zipline you will use drones to deliver critical and lifesaving medicine to thousands of hospitals serving millions of people in multiple countries. Our mission is to provide every human on Earth with instant access to vital medical supplies. Join Zipline and help us make this a reality for billions of people.</div>\n<br>\n<div>\n<h3><strong>About You and The Role</strong> </h3><br><br>As a member of the Embedded Systems team at Zipline, you will go deep in your area of ownership, becoming an expert in the problem domain, defining requirements for systems, rapidly developing creative and simple solutions, and proving with testing and data that the system meets the rigors and edge-cases of real-world deployment. Embedded Systems engineers also contribute beyond their field--reviewing schematics, building user interfaces, designing hardware in the loop test systems, and more.\n<br><br>\nZipline designs and operates the world's largest drone delivery service providing access to critical medical supplies. Leading the way in drone delivery often means exceeding the capabilities of what's available off the shelf and as a result we are engineering the majority of our system in-house. Doubling down on the reliability of our systems and inventing new robots is a critical path to delivering to our next billion customers--people whose lives will be meaningfully affected by smarter, more equitable access. We are deliberately expanding our embedded systems capabilities and adding to the ranks of our experienced team to achieve these goals.\n<br><br>\n<h3>What You'll Do</h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You'll work hands-on prototyping novel delivery aircraft systems. Your team will be iterating rapidly to test ideas around aerodynamics, controls, and delivery for our next generation aircraft.</li>\n<li>You'll develop software to run missions, interface with sensors and actuators, compute trajectories, profile mechanical systems, control dynamic systems, and more.</li>\n<li>You'll test your software on real aircraft at our secret test site, and work alongside mechanical and control systems engineers to identify and fix problems in a cross-disciplinary setting.</li>\n<li>You'll use and modify custom simulation tools to design and de-risk flight test plans ahead of time.</li>\n<li>You will be mentored by a world-class embedded systems engineer committed to your learning and growth</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h3>What You'll Bring</h3><br><br><strong>Please complete this required challenge to apply:</strong> https://flyzipline.app.box.com/s/scnx6p86h1a6oevuqnpgdlyux8f1cp7z\n<br><br>\nWe think this game will be a fun but unbiased, execution-focused (vs resume-focused) way of seeing if we're all a match for each other.

Test the system with unit tests and in HITL. Deploy it to all aircraft and ground systems in Rwanda, Ghana and the U.S. Build data analysis tools to check data across the fleet. Use this data to root cause tricky failures that improve the reliability of our fleet so that patients get life saving medical products when they need them</li>\n<li>Rapidly iterate on the concepts for a new perception system, integrating compute modules and sensor prototypes to fly a proof of concept ASAP and de-risk key aspects of the approach.</li>\n<li>Build a system to multiplex batteries between chargers, reducing charging times and operator fatigue. Iterate on the design and user interface with the engineering and operations team, traveling to our test site in Davis with a mocked up user interface to get feedback. Deploy the system into the field, allowing us to finally serve hospitals that have been waiting for medical products.</li>\n<li>Immediately respond to, reproduce and root cause failures so that everyone can get their medical products when they need them</li>\n<li>Find ways to make the codebase better for other engineers through every feature built, for example removing tech debt or cruft, adding debugging or logging tools, increasing test coverage, improving toolchains or build times, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What Else You Need to Know</h3> \n<br>\n<div>Zipline is an equal opportunity employer and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws or our own sensibilities.</div>\n<br>\n<div>We value diversity at Zipline and welcome applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech.

Please see our website for upcoming start-dates, and please let us know which months you would be able to begin class, below. Check any that apply. *<br>April 26, 2021<br>Do you have any background in IT?

However, during the current crisis, we are strongly supporting interns working from home using remote access to the personal tutoring and all of the IT technology available to our interns.<br><br>Program hours?<br><br>8 hours a day are mandatory, typically 8am to 5pm.<br><br>Number of days per week?<br><br>Monday through Friday. Additionally, there are supplementary hours for further study on Saturdays, typically attended by more than half the participants working with tutors and on their own projects.<br><br>When do programs start?<br><br>Please see above on the ’Enrollment/Registration’ page for information on upcoming class dates.<br><br>Do I need IT experience?<br><br>No. Our program is designed for participants who lack IT experience—our program is focused on training participants with NO IT experience to a very high level of expertise in 5 months. With that said, even if you have some IT background (a 2 or 4 year degree, without extensive industry experience, for example) we are confident that our program will be beneficial for you.<br><br><b>Program Costs:</b><br>What is the cost of the program?<br><br>$35,000, once you transition into a good paying job.<br><br>We support a Pay for Success model, where you repay the program’s cost only when you are employed with a good salary. You need to be making over $45,000 per year, then you only pay 9% of your salary until you have covered the cost of the program and servicing fees. If your income falls below $45,000, your repayment is suspended. After six years, your commitment ends - even if the cost isn’t fully repaid; this isn’t a loan. And we clearly believe our students are going to be highly successful after they graduate.<br><br><b>Employment and Certification:</b><br>Will I have a job at the end of this program?<br><br>Historically, 40% of participants have transitioned into full-time employment with the end of the program; 70% are employed within 3 months; 98% are employed or have entered a traditional college program at 6 months.<br><br>What sort of job would I be able to get with this course?<br><br>Acuitus prepares students for compelling careers in IT. Our graduates have landed jobs in systems and network administration, technical support, network engineering, systems engineering, sales engineering. Many have landed positions right out of Acuitus in IT Management and senior technical roles, jobs typically taken by IT professionals with five to ten years experience in industry. The variety of employers that have hired Acuitus graduates reflects a wide range of large enterprises, technology providers, regional IT providers, System Integrators as well as startups. The choice of potential employers allows graduates to make the trade-offs they are most comfortable with in terms of specialization, career trajectory, geographic location, corporate culture and other critical factors in choosing a career.<br><br>Is any certification or degree offered as part of the course?<br><br>This program focuses on transforming you into an expert, teaching you the hard ideas, and getting you experience, in short the elements that make advanced certifications hard for most people. Most students complete at least the first half of the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) certification before they graduate and many complete both parts. Other certifications that students have passed during the course include: COMPTIA certifications (such as Linux + and Network+); and, the MCSA (Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate).<br><br>Where will I be working after I graduate?<br><br>Our corporate partners represent a wide range of industries. Some are large enterprises with locations spread across the country and around the world. Some are technology companies with exciting high-growth businesses supplying products and services to large corporations. Others are smaller regional firms that want to hire mature, independent professionals with great IT skills.<br><br>Does Acuitus get a fee if I’m hired by one of your corporate partners?<br><br>No, Acuitus does not receive compensation for placement. Our job is to make sure you are the best IT professional you can be before you graduate and to prepare you to find the best job to meet your needs and your desires. We have no financial stake in who employs you or where you are employed.<br><br>How much will I be making in my new job? Is this only preparing me for an entry-level position?<br><br>We are NOT preparing you for an entry-level job. Your salary level upon graduation depends on a number of factors, including your specific interests in the field of IT, the geographic location in which you choose to seek work, whether you want to work for a small company or a large company, whether you were passionate about IT and the companies you interviewed with. And historically, our graduates have seen an average increase in salary of 14% per year over five years, which is notable.",

We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by \"keeping the lights on\" 24/7.\n<br><br>\nAs the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.\n<br><br>\nThe California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others. In the same way, the California ISO operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.<br><br>Job Description<br><br><strong>What's In it for You</strong>\n<br><br>\nOur purpose is to lead the way to tomorrow's energy network.
