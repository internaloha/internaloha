        "description": "<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS) mission involves problem-solving research in the widely diverse food and agricultural areas encompassing plant production and protection; animal production and protection; natural resources and sustainable agricultural systems; and nutrition; food safety; and quality. The programs are conducted in 46 of the 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For ARS to maintain its standing as a premier scientific organization, major investments in computing, networking, and storage infrastructure are required. Training in data and information management are integral to the integrity, security, and accessibility of research findings, results, and outcomes within the ARS research enterprise. Nearly 2000 scientists and support staff conduct research within the ARS research enterprise.</p><p><br></p><p>The SCINet/Big Data Research Participation Program of the USDA ARS offers research opportunities to motivated postdoctoral fellows interested in working on agricultural- and natural resource-related problems at a range of spatial and temporal scales, from the genome to the continent, and sub-daily to evolutionary time scales. One of the goals of the SCINet Initiative is to develop and apply new technologies, including AI and machine learning, to help solve complex agricultural problems that also depend on collaboration across scientific disciplines and geographic locations. In addition, many of these technologies rely on the synthesis, integration, and analysis of large, diverse datasets that benefit from high performance computers (HPC). The objective of this fellowship is to facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-location research through collaborative research on problems of interest to each applicant and amenable to or required by the HPC environment. Training will be provided in specific AI, machine learning, deep learning, and statistical software needed for the HPC.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the course of this research project, the participant&nbsp;will learn about conducting agricultural research within the context of the ARS Big Data Initiative (BDI;&nbsp;scinet.usda.gov). The BDI is responsible for three major components: (1) a high-capacity network as the backbone of a research data and information conduit among ARS locations (SciNet); (2) high-performance computing and storage infrastructure available to all ARS scientific staff; and (3) a virtual research support core (VRSC), a group of personnel with diverse skills in scientific computing that provides support and training to ARS scientists and staff. Under the guidance of a mentor, the&nbsp;participant will have the opportunity to gain experience in and&nbsp;learn about the challenges in predicting dynamics of agro-ecosystems while learning a range of computational skills needed to conduct analyses in an HPC and cloud-based environment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Learning Objectives</u>:&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;participant will&nbsp;have the opportunity to learn AI technologies through our AI Center of Excellence, and will develop and co-lead ARS-wide workshops resulting in a community of scientific practice for a multi-disciplinary topic within our National Programs. The&nbsp;participant will also&nbsp;have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple USDA ARS scientists on data analysis projects, and to write collaborative scientific papers dealing with agro-ecosystem problems across multiple spatial and temporal scales.</p>",

All fellows will spend time at headquarters for some of their training, but will be based&nbsp;in&nbsp;another ARS research unit&nbsp;for more specific training.&nbsp;The SCINet/Big Data Program at ARS offers research opportunities to motivated participants interested in&nbsp;solving agricultural- and natural resource-related problems at a range of spatial and temporal scales, from the genome to the continent, and sub-daily to evolutionary time scales, as well as metadata enhancement for data discovery. One of the goals of the SCINet Initiative is to develop and apply new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, to help solve complex agricultural problems that also depend on collaboration across scientific disciplines and geographic locations. In addition, many of these technologies rely on the synthesis, integration, linkage, and analysis of large, diverse datasets that benefit from high performance computers (HPC). The objective of these opportunities is to facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-location research through collaborative research on problems of interest to each&nbsp;participant and amenable to or required by the HPC environment. Training will be provided in specific AI, machine learning, deep learning, and statistical software needed for the HPC.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Research Project</u>:&nbsp;</strong>Agro-ecosystem dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales need to account for interactions within and among spatial units, such as movement of animals that can spread disease, spatial heterogeneity in soils leading to variability in crop yield, and extreme weather resulting in large pulses in production in one year followed by losses in the next year. Machine learning, deep learning, and other AI technologies combined with geospatial software for analysis (e.g., ArcGIS) provide promise to reduce uncertainty in predictions of agricultural production under these highly variable spatial and temporal conditions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Learning Objectives</u>:&nbsp;</strong>The successful candidate will have the opportunity to learn about the challenges in predicting dynamics of agro-ecosystems while learning a range of computational skills needed to conduct complex geospatial analyses in an HPC and cloud-based environment. The successful candidate will also learn AI technologies relevant to these problems. The successful candidate will also have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple USDA ARS scientists on data analysis projects, and to write collaborative scientific papers dealing with geospatial analyses across multiple spatial and temporal scales.</p>",

All fellows will spend time at headquarters for some of their training, but will be based&nbsp;in&nbsp;another ARS research unit&nbsp;for more specific training.&nbsp;The SCINet/Big Data Program at ARS offers research opportunities to motivated participants interested in&nbsp;solving agricultural- and natural resource-related problems at a range of spatial and temporal scales, from the genome to the continent, and sub-daily to evolutionary time scales, as well as metadata enhancement for data discovery. One of the goals of the SCINet Initiative is to develop and apply new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, to help solve complex agricultural problems that also depend on collaboration across scientific disciplines and geographic locations. In addition, many of these technologies rely on the synthesis, integration, linkage, and analysis of large, diverse datasets that benefit from high performance computers (HPC). The objective of these opportunities is to facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-location research through collaborative research on problems of interest to each&nbsp;participant and amenable to or required by the HPC environment. Training will be provided in specific AI, machine learning, deep learning, and statistical software needed for the HPC.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Research Project</u>:&nbsp;</strong>Agro-ecosystem dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales need to account for interactions within and among spatial units, such as movement of animals that can spread disease, spatial heterogeneity in soils leading to variability in crop yield, and extreme weather resulting in large pulses in production in one year followed by losses in the next year. Machine learning, deep learning, and other AI technologies combined with geospatial software for analysis (e.g., ArcGIS) provide promise to reduce uncertainty in predictions of agricultural production under these highly variable spatial and temporal conditions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Learning Objectives</u>:&nbsp;</strong>The successful candidate will have the opportunity to learn about the challenges in predicting dynamics of agro-ecosystems while learning a range of computational skills needed to conduct complex geospatial analyses in an HPC and cloud-based environment. The successful candidate will also learn AI technologies relevant to these problems. The successful candidate will also have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple USDA ARS scientists on data analysis projects, and to write collaborative scientific papers dealing with geospatial analyses across multiple spatial and temporal scales.</p>",
