        "description": "<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS) mission involves problem-solving research in the widely diverse food and agricultural areas encompassing plant production and protection; animal production and protection; natural resources and sustainable agricultural systems; and nutrition; food safety; and quality. The programs are conducted in 46 of the 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For ARS to maintain its standing as a premier scientific organization, major investments in computing, networking, and storage infrastructure are required. Training in data and information management are integral to the integrity, security, and accessibility of research findings, results, and outcomes within the ARS research enterprise. Nearly 2000 scientists and support staff conduct research within the ARS research enterprise.</p><p><br></p><p>The SCINet/Big Data Research Participation Program of the USDA ARS offers research opportunities to motivated postdoctoral fellows interested in working on agricultural- and natural resource-related problems at a range of spatial and temporal scales, from the genome to the continent, and sub-daily to evolutionary time scales. One of the goals of the SCINet Initiative is to develop and apply new technologies, including AI and machine learning, to help solve complex agricultural problems that also depend on collaboration across scientific disciplines and geographic locations. In addition, many of these technologies rely on the synthesis, integration, and analysis of large, diverse datasets that benefit from high performance computers (HPC). The objective of this fellowship is to facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-location research through collaborative research on problems of interest to each applicant and amenable to or required by the HPC environment. Training will be provided in specific AI, machine learning, deep learning, and statistical software needed for the HPC.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the course of this research project, the participant&nbsp;will learn about conducting agricultural research within the context of the ARS Big Data Initiative (BDI;&nbsp;scinet.usda.gov). The BDI is responsible for three major components: (1) a high-capacity network as the backbone of a research data and information conduit among ARS locations (SciNet); (2) high-performance computing and storage infrastructure available to all ARS scientific staff; and (3) a virtual research support core (VRSC), a group of personnel with diverse skills in scientific computing that provides support and training to ARS scientists and staff. Under the guidance of a mentor, the&nbsp;participant will have the opportunity to gain experience in and&nbsp;learn about the challenges in predicting dynamics of agro-ecosystems while learning a range of computational skills needed to conduct analyses in an HPC and cloud-based environment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Learning Objectives</u>:&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;participant will&nbsp;have the opportunity to learn AI technologies through our AI Center of Excellence, and will develop and co-lead ARS-wide workshops resulting in a community of scientific practice for a multi-disciplinary topic within our National Programs. The&nbsp;participant will also&nbsp;have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple USDA ARS scientists on data analysis projects, and to write collaborative scientific papers dealing with agro-ecosystem problems across multiple spatial and temporal scales.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) Research Participation Programs at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are educational and training programs designed to provide undergraduate and graduate students, post-master and post-doctoral, and faculty&nbsp;opportunities to participate in project-specific research and developmental activities at the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR).&nbsp;The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, and medical devices; and by ensuring the safety of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation.&nbsp;The mission of NCTR is to conduct scientific research to develop and support innovative tools and evaluation of approaches that FDA uses to protect and promote individual and public health.&nbsp;To accomplish its mission, NCTR has established three strategic goals to ensure the conduct of innovative regulatory-science research vital to FDA.&nbsp;Regulatory Science-the science of developing and establishing tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of regulated products-is the foundation of decision-making at FDA. The three strategic goals are:</p><ul><li>Advance scientific approaches and tools required to support public health.</li><li>Promote global interactions in regulatory science research.</li><li>Improve administrative management and develop new communication materials and methods to support HHS/FDA science goals.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>This is an open announcement to collect applicants for future research opportunities.&nbsp;The opportunities include full-time, part-time,&nbsp;and summer appointments at NCTR.</p><p><br></p><p>This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and FDA. The initial appointment is for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of&nbsp;FDA contingent on the availability of funds. The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. The appointment is full-time&nbsp;at FDA in the Jefferson, Arkansas, area. Participants do not become employees of FDA, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.</p><p><br></p><p>Completion of a successful background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management is required for an applicant to be on-boarded at FDA.&nbsp;OPM can complete a background investigation only for individuals, including non-US Citizens, who have resided in the US for a total of three of the past five years.</p><p><br></p><p>FDA requires ORISE participants to read and sign their FDA Education and Training Agreement within 30 days of his/her start date, setting forth the conditions and expectations for his/her educational appointment at the agency.&nbsp;This agreement covers such topics as the following:</p><ul><li>Non-employee nature of the ORISE appointment;</li><li>Prohibition on ORISE Fellows performing inherently governmental functions;</li><li>Obligation of ORISE Fellows to convey all necessary rights to the FDA regarding intellectual property conceived or first reduced to practice during their fellowship;</li><li>The fact that research materials and laboratory notebooks are the property of the FDA;</li><li>ORISE fellow’s obligation to protect and not to further disclose or use non-public information.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>See&nbsp;http://orise.orau.gov/fda/default.htm&nbsp;or&nbsp;http://www.fda.gov/&nbsp;for more information.</p>",

Initial research location may be remote depending on COVID restrictions.</p><p><br></p><p>At the heart of the U.S. Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the U.S. Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Research Project</u>:&nbsp;</strong>The overarching goal is to use structural measures from NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) instrument and in situ measurements from the Experimental Forests&nbsp;Ranges (EFR) and the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) to explore forest biodiversity and its relation to structural diversity, and to relate both types of diversity to productivity,&nbsp;carbon cycling and major disturbances such as fire, drought, invasive pest outbreaks, and sea-level rises.</p><p><br></p><p>The specific objectives designed to achieve the overarching goals are to:</p><ul><li>Map both structural and species diversity of southern forests using data from GEDI, other satellite data, and measurements from the EFR network and FIA;</li><li>Evaluate the performance of GEDI products for estimating forest structural and plant diversity of all species at the site level;</li><li>Quantify forest structural diversity - productivity (carbon cycling) relations at local and regional scales;</li><li>Elucidate how structural diversity regulates the resilience of forest productivity/carbon sequestration to fire and drought.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Learning Objectives</u>:&nbsp;</strong>Our proposed project will examine how structural diversity is related to forest productivity and&nbsp;carbon sequestration (and thus water use), and explore the resilience of southern forests to fire and drought, and therefore will address SRS priority research areas in Fire, Water, and Restoration. This study combines expertise from multiple RWUs and Centers, incorporating field data from all the EFRs and FIA. Forest restoration to improve forest ecosystems services is a high priority area of R8 and Southern Group of State Foresters. Our proposed work therefore addresses all the four criteria of this solicitation. Through this research and collaboration, the follow will</p><ul><li>Gain an appreciation of the practical challenges and limitations of remote sensing in both short and long-term monitoring and assessments in forest ecosystems</li><li>Improve understanding of fundamental monitoring needs and how evolving technology can assist forest management in the future</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Mentor</u>:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The mentors for this opportunity&nbsp;include Qinfeng Guo, Jeff Atkins, Jingfeng Xiao, and Ge Sun.

        "description": "<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS) mission involves problem-solving research in the widely diverse food and agricultural areas encompassing plant production and protection; animal production and protection; natural resources and sustainable agricultural systems; and nutrition; food safety; and quality. The programs are conducted in 46 of the 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For ARS to maintain its standing as a premier scientific organization, major investments in computing, networking, and storage infrastructure are required. Training in data and information management are integral to the integrity, security, and accessibility of research findings, results, and outcomes within the ARS research enterprise. Nearly 2000 scientists and support staff conduct research within the ARS research enterprise.</p><p><br></p><p>The SCINet/Big Data Research Participation Program of the USDA ARS offers research opportunities to motivated postdoctoral fellows interested in working on agricultural- and natural resource-related problems at a range of spatial and temporal scales, from the genome to the continent, and sub-daily to evolutionary time scales. One of the goals of the SCINet Initiative is to develop and apply new technologies, including AI and machine learning, to help solve complex agricultural problems that also depend on collaboration across scientific disciplines and geographic locations. In addition, many of these technologies rely on the synthesis, integration, and analysis of large, diverse datasets that benefit from high performance computers (HPC). The objective of this fellowship is to facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-location research through collaborative research on problems of interest to each applicant and amenable to or required by the HPC environment. Training will be provided in specific AI, machine learning, deep learning, and statistical software needed for the HPC.</p><p><br></p><p>Agro-ecosystem dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales need to account for interactions within and among spatial units, such as movement of pests and animals that can spread disease, spatial heterogeneity in soils leading to variability in crop yield, and extreme weather resulting in large pulses in production in one year followed by losses in the next year. Machine learning, deep learning, and other AI technologies combined with high performance computing (HPC) or cloud computing provide promise to reduce uncertainty in predictions of agricultural production under these highly variable spatial and temporal conditions. Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will learn AI technologies relevant to these problems, and will help develop and co-lead ARS-wide workshops resulting in a community of scientific practice on geospatial problems with AI.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Learning Objectives</u>:&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;participant will have the opportunity to learn about the challenges in predicting dynamics of agro-ecosystems while learning a range of computational skills needed to conduct complex geospatial analyses in an HPC and cloud-based environment. The&nbsp;participant will have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple USDA ARS scientists on data analysis projects, and to write collaborative scientific papers dealing with geospatial analyses and AI across multiple spatial and temporal scales.</p>",
