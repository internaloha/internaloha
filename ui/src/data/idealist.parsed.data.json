You will experience the stark contrast between Western medical practice and the realities of medicine in developing countries. As the hospitals and clinics are still modernizing, there are many challenges faced and as a result you will also see medical conditions that have remained untreated and have developed to an advanced pathological stage. Therefore this project not only provides you with responsibility, it also allows you to broaden your perspective by working at a hospital/health clinic in a developing country.</p><p>Furthermore, you can gain experience in a range of different departments and activities within the hospital/health clinic, such as: emergency, pediatric, maternity (only female volunteers), diabetes, integral attention &amp; prevention for HIV, tuberculosis and uterine cancer as well as nursing, hospital administration and management assisting with accountancy and helping with statistics. There is also the possibility to work in the hospital pharmacy. You are welcome to also work on our other projects such as the English and computer literacy classes for locals.</p><p>This opportunity will give you an insight into the day to day running of a hospital or clinic. You will experience the stark contrast between western medical practice and the realities of medicine in developing countries. As the hospitals and clinics are still modernizing there are many challenges faced and there are realities not often seen in developed countries. Therefore, this project not only provides you with responsibility, it also allows you to broaden your perspective by working at a hospital/health clinic in a developing country where you will be faced with the stark realities of the disparities between medical practice in the developed and developing world. This means that, sadly, you will also see medical conditions that have remained untreated and have developed to an advanced pathological stage uncommon in developed countries. Furthermore, you can gain experience in a range of different departments and activities within the hospital, such as: Emergency, Pediatry, Maternity (only female volunteers), Diabetes and Integral Attention &amp; Prevention for HIV, Tuberculosis and Uterine Cancer as well as Nursing, Hospital administration and management assisting with accountancy and helping with statistics. There is also the possibility to work in the pharmacy.</p><p>Your level of possible involvement will largely depend on your Spanish language skills and experiences in the field, as well as your motivation and willingness to get involved. It will also depend on the current needs and tasks at the hospital as we really want to help out wherever our help is needed most. Your work schedule will be created in a meeting with the departmental director and the volunteer coordinator and supervisor. In this process we always try to match your interests and skills with the current situation at the hospital. In order to gain the most out of your experience, and especially if you have a specific health care goal, please contact us in advance to discuss your options in detail. Please keep in mind that hospitalized patient care in the Dominican Republic is much less extensive compared to nursery practices in the western world! It is common to see that family members are expected to take care of their patient at the hospital.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What to expect</strong></p><p>You can join this program throughout the whole year. Working hours will be primarily in the morning when the physicians are at the hospital/health clinic while in healthcare 24 hour rotations are implemented. As with any medical service, volunteers should recognize that their schedules may be subject to sudden changes and are dictated by patients’ needs.</p><p><strong>Activities can include but are not limited to&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Observing, shadowing and assisting doctors and nurses during their work</li><li>Participating in patient care: comforting patients and assisting with examinations</li><li>Providing ambulance support when needed</li><li>Assisting, teaching and encouraging prevention, hygiene and checkups</li><li>Assisting in developing educational materials and engagement strategies for various prevention programs using multimedia&nbsp;</li><li>Helping regularly with hospital administration tasks and helping improve procedures and workflow</li><li>Some volunteers may also choose to teach English to the doctors, provided that there is a sufficient number of doctors interested</li><li>Foreign medical missions visit and work at the hospital several times a year. You may accompany them and translate for them and the patients</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This program is suitable for pre-medical students and students of pharmaceutics as well as nursing students with free holiday time, pre-university students, students taking or planning to take specialist medical courses such as biomedical science, nursing and physiotherapy as well as professionals. The key requirements for a medical volunteer or intern are initiative, enthusiasm, and readiness to work in unfamiliar circumstances. If volunteers have more specialized skills, this will allow for more specialized activities. Basic conversational Spanish skills are required and the more advanced your level of experience and Spanish language skills, the larger the number of opportunities available. To allow a deeper engagement with your placement we offer free Spanish language lessons every week allowing for an enhanced experience as a volunteer/intern with us. Suggestions on what to bring: Please bring scrubs and easy to clean comfortable closed shoes to wear as they are mandatory</p><p>Please bring scrubs and closed shoes that are easy to clean for working in the hospital, as they are mandatory. Latex gloves, hand sanitizer and face masks (N95 for the TB patients) would be a very helpful donation to the dental clinic.</p><p><strong>Guidelines on medical Issues of the Dominican Republic:</strong></p><ul><li>WHO reportcon health care reform in Dominican Republic, 2010</li><li>Health System of the Dominican Republic, 2011.

Also tell us about your personal expectations and goals and we will see how we can help you achieve them.</p><p><strong>Time Commitment&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A minimum time commitment of 2 weeks is required. For volunteers and interns with little experience, a six to eight week minimum time commitment is encouraged. You can join this program throughout the whole year. Working hours will be primarily in the morning when the physicians are at the hospital/health clinic while in healthcare 24 hour rotations are implemented. As with any medical service, volunteers should recognize that their schedules may be subject to sudden changes and are dictated by patients’ needs.
