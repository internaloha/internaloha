        "description": "<p>Interns are recruited year-round on a semester basis for positions in CFR’s New York and Washington, DC, offices. An intern’s duties generally consist of research, editing and writing, event coordination, and/or departmental support. Internships are offered in Digital Content, the Studies Program, Global Communications, Corporate Program, Washington Program, Meetings Program and many more, including&nbsp;Foreign Affairs.</p><p>Interns participate in CFR’s Intern Professional Development program, which complements their substantive work with a series of skill-based workshops, training, and career advice sessions. These events are designed to improve interns’ writing, editing, research, and program planning skills, while also helping to sharpen interns’ resumes and familiarize them with the multitude of foreign policy career paths and beyond.</p><p>CFR generally considers undergraduate and graduate students with majors in international relations, political science, economics, or a related field for its Internship Program. All applicants should&nbsp;have completed the equivalent of four semesters of college coursework (not including AP classes in high school) by the time they begin an internship.&nbsp;A regional specialization, language skills, and additional requirements may also be needed for some internships. In addition to meeting the intellectual requirements, applicants should have excellent skills in administration, writing, research, and computers, as well as previous office experience. Interns must also be willing to commit to fourteen to eighteen hours per week.</p><p><strong>All fall 2021 internships will be on a fully remote/virtual basis.</strong></p><p><strong>To apply, visit this link: https://www.cfr.org/career-opportunities/internships</strong></p><p><strong>CFR has rolling applications.</strong></p>",
