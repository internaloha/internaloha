        "description": "<p>[ <strong>As of June 2020,&nbsp;Quora has become a \"remote-first\" company.</strong> This position can be performed remotely from anywhere in the world, regardless of any location that might be specified above.]</p><p><strong>About Quora:</strong><br><br>The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.<br><br><strong>About our Internship:</strong><br><br>A Quora internship is not an ordinary internship. There's no busy work. Every project that our interns work on is important to the company and its goals.<br><br>As a team, we are dedicated to holding high standards, developing a strong and passionate culture, and emphasizing impact. We value building a culture with strong engineering values and goals because we believe that it is the key to building a great company and product. Interns play an important role in this, as they work alongside full-time employees as equals, working on the same projects that help drive the company and product forward. We expect interns to become valuable contributors to the team, as they work hand-in-hand with people ranging from engineering to design to business development.<br><br>We also realize that mentorship is important to allow interns to grow and develop skills in areas which they're looking to improve. For example, every intern will have a full-time engineer as a mentor, and weekly 1:1s with their managers to get feedback and ensure things are going well. We also emphasize code reviews and hold weekly engineering tech talks to maintain high code quality and to optimize for learning the best engineering practices.<br><br>Interns can expect to work in the same areas as full-time engineers, which include:</p><ul><li><strong>Product Systems</strong>: architect and scale user-facing product features to drive engagement and help the product grow.</li><li><strong>Platform</strong>: create the tools, abstractions, frameworks, and systems to make developers at Quora more productive across all platforms — from product developers to ML engineers.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure: </strong>design and build fast, cost-efficient, self-healing and scalable architectures to serve our ever-growing global traffic and storage needs.</li><li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: build systems and processes that apply ML technologies, including ranking, content quality, text understanding, search, ads targeting and CTR prediction, etc.</li></ul><p><br><strong>Minimum Qualifications</strong>:</p><ul><li>Pursuing a B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Engineering or a related technical field</li><li>Knowledge of Python, Javascript, or C++, or the ability to learn them quickly</li><li>A passion for learning and always improving yourself and the team around you</li><li>Love of the Quora product</li></ul><p><strong>Preferred Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Prior software engineering internship experience with web applications, databases, or distributed systems</li></ul>",

This notice is issued under direct-hire authority to recruit new talent to occupations for which NIST has a severe shortage of candidates. Responsibilities This position will: Develop novel measurement tools and methods to characterize and improve digital light projection photopolymerized additively-manufactured (PAM) hydrogel and polymeric materials. Develop optical systems to integrate NIST methods with AM processes, for in situ measurements of material formation. Use dynamic atomic force microscopy, nanoindentation, and cryo-ultramicrotomy to investigate effects of voxel processing on cure depth, cure kinetics, interlayer heterogeneity, mechanical behavior, microstructure, and cellularization. Work with industry partners to establish formal collaborative agreements to create innovative, high-impact research programs, and transfer their successes directly to industry. The principal duties for this position are on the Boulder, CO campus of NIST. Duties include interacting with and collaborating with a multidisciplinary scientific workforce with experience ranging from student interns to Ph.D. level staff scientists. Requirements Conditions of Employment Qualifications BASIC REQUIREMENTS: A. Degree: Engineering. To be acceptable, the program must: (1) lead to a bachelor's degree in a school of engineering with at least one program accredited by ABET; or (2) include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics.

The qualification requirements in this vacancy announcement are based on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Qualification Standards Handbook. Applicant Reconsideration Education This position has an education requirement. Transcripts must be submitted to validate that the education requirement has been met. Unofficial transcripts will be accepted in the application package. However, an official copy will be required prior to a final offer of employment. Education completed outside of the U.S. must be evaluated by an accredited organization to ensure that it is comparable to education received in accredited institutions in the U.S. Click here to view a listing of accredited organizations from the Department of Education's website. A copy of the foreign education evaluation (containing the results with a course by course listing) is required with your application. Additional Information The physical worksite for this position is located in Boulder, Colorado. However, the Material Measurement Laboratory is currently under a maximum telework posture due to the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, this position is currently under a 100 percent telework schedule. The position's telework schedule will likely change in the future when Material Measurement Laboratory moves away from its maximum telework posture. At that time, the incumbent will be expected to report to the physical work site in accordance with the updated status requirements of their supervisor. The nature and scope of future telework opportunities will be subject to the unit's telework policy, any applicable bargaining unit agreements, and supervisory approval. Payment of relocation expenses, as applicable, will be paid in accordance with this Job Opportunity Announcement. Non-compliance with the supervisor's telework-schedule requirement could result in adverse action, including separation. This position is covered under NIST's Alternative Personnel Management System (APMS). The APMS is a pay-for-performance system with excellent HR flexibilities to help NIST recruit and retain top talent. Find out more about the APMS here! A probationary period may be required. We may share your application package with other selecting officials at NIST with opportunities like this one. Additional selections may be made through this vacancy.
