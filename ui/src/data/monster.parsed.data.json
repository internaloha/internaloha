Projects are cross functional, which allow insight into new languages and technologies, help encourage professional growth within engineering, and allow a sense of ownership within the team.<br><br>Meraki’s engineering teams place a high emphasis on mentorship. Each intern and co-op is matched 1:1 with a mentor who provides continual feedback and guidance throughout the duration of the program. Mentors help with introductions to other team members, overviews of tools and processes, and provide a seamless integration into Meraki life. <br><br>Examples of Past Projects <br><br>* Adding at-rest encryption to our cloud-based database backups<br><br>* Revamping our Organization Move process to move customers between servers<br><br>* Implementing Docker Containers to move our infrastructure to a containerized world<br><br>Intern Benefits: <br><br>* Housing Assistance <br><br>* Competitive salary<br><br>* Weekly social events inside and outside of the office (Giants games, Exploratorium tickets, friendly soccer games)<br><br>* Lunch and dinner daily<br><br>* Customized laptop and desk setups<br><br>* Medical, dental, and vision coverage plans<br><br>Cisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis.
