A proven record of publications (at least one first-author paper in reputed conferences such as NeurIPS, COLT, UAI, ICML, AISTATS, JMLR, PAMI, and others) and prototyping skills in terms of developing algorithms, in any language, is critical.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAs an industry R&amp;D laboratory, we pursue theoretical and applied research to feed into the other. Like academia, knowledge dissemination is through the publication of papers in reputed journals, conferences and workshops, and patents. We have current collaborations with world-renowned academic institutions; encouraging such industry-academia partnerships is important for research scientists.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n*Qualifications, skills and other information:*\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\t* Internship applicants will generally study towards a PhD degree in computer science, engineering, statistics, mathematics, and allied disciplines. (core requirement)\n\n\t* Knowledge of reinforcement learning (essential) and multi-agent systems (desirable)\n\n\t* Knowledge of Bayesian statistics (desirable)\n\n\t* Hands-on experience with at least one of the following: Python, C/C++, Java, etc. (core requirement)\n\n\t* REQUIRED: Concrete experience in reinforcement learning that goes beyond downloading an RL codebase and running it.\n\n\t* Data science and 'concrete' experience in RL are very different â the latter requires prowess both in mathematics and computer science, REQUIRED for this role. This difference is paramount. Someone who just has ML and Python on their CVs do not qualify them for RL.\n\n\t* Good candidates may have (a) published in the field of RL in top conferences i.e., original contribution, or (b) have a codebase that is original in GitHub/Bitbucket.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n*Apply Today! *\n\n\n Why KellyÂ®?\n \n\nBy partnering with KellyÂ® Technology, youâll have direct connections to top companies around the globeâgiving you the chance to put your tech skills to work on some of todayâs most intriguing, innovative, and high-visibility projects. In a world where change is the only constant, our unparalleled connections and IT market expertise help you take your skills exactly where you want to go. Weâre here to help you gain experience, keep learning, and move your career forward.\n\n\n About KellyÂ®\n \n\nAt Kelly, weâre always thinking about whatâs next and advising job seekers on new ways of working to reach their full potential. In fact, weâre a leading advocate for temporary/nontraditional workstyles, because we believe they allow flexibility and tremendous growth opportunities that enable a better way to work and live (plus, did we mention we provide a ton of [benefits](https://www.mykelly.us/us-mykelly/perks/)?).
