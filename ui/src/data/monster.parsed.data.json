We have opportunities to join teams working on public-facing features as well as dev tools and core infrastructure.</p><p>You'll be helping us build new and awesome experiences for people buying and selling on Etsy. We're looking for full-stack engineers - you'll be dealing with the MySQL, Memcache, PHP, and front-end stuff (HTML/CSS/JS).

Our current systems run PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, Solr/Lucene, Postgres, MySQL, and more.

        "description": "<div><p><em>At Nuna, our mission is to make high-quality healthcare affordable for everyone. We are dedicated to tackling one of our nation’s biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.</em><em><br></em><em><br></em><em>Nuna is committed to simple principles: a rigorous understanding of data, modern technology, and most importantly, compassion and care for our fellow human. We want to know what really works, what doesn't—and why.</em><em><br></em><em><br></em><em>Nuna partners with healthcare payers, including government agencies, health plans, and employers, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.</em></p><h4>YOUR TEAM</h4><p>In Nuna Engineering, we build technology to enable users (from data scientists to analysts to policy-makers) to understand healthcare data while ensuring its integrity, security and privacy. Our work runs the gamut from joining streams of messy real-world data to building queryable data warehouses to building APIs to power healthcare business processes. We build systems that are auditable, automated, accurate, and, most importantly, responsive to our end users' needs. We strive for a creative, collaborative engineering environment that implements best practices of peer review, readability, maintainability, privacy, and security of the code base and infrastructure.</p><p>The Nuna Meaningful Matches engineering team is responsible for building the APIs, schemas and business logic to power our product. We work with the output of Nuna’s Data Platform, turning large datasets into innovative and highly reliable APIs. Through the usage of machine learning, our APIs bring new capabilities to healthcare - enabling fairer and more accurate matchmaking between doctors and patients in real time.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a high-impact, remote, 12-week paid internship starting in June for students graduating by 2022.&nbsp;</p><h4>YOUR IMPACT</h4><p>Our engineering team builds the product that healthcare companies interact with. We measure our products’ success by how much they improve care, access, and lower costs. As an engineering-led culture, you will be at the vanguard of making healthcare work for all Americans. You’ll be helping patients with access to primary care physicians that match their needs.</p><h4>YOUR OPPORTUNITIES</h4><ul><li style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">You’ll put data science magic (predictive analytics, dynamic modeling and machine learning) into our users’ hands through interactive features in collaboration with the Data Engineering &amp; Data Science teams.&nbsp;</li><li style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">You’ll design APIs that multiply the effectiveness of external developers serving millions of patients.</li><li style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">You’ll observe and interact with our industry leading production environment, ensuring high availability/low latency and protecting our sensitive data with rigorous security and privacy controls.</li><li style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">You’ll learn from more senior engineers, because we are learners, not knowers, and you’ll have the opportunity to influence them, because growing Nuna’s people is the most reliable way to scale our impact.</li><li style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">You’ll work as part of a team, not in a silo. At Nuna we rise by lifting others.</li><li style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">You’ll work closely with other interns and participate in resume and career planning workshops throughout the duration of your internship.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>YOU BRING</h4><p>As a backend engineering team, we need a wide array of skills as a whole. No single engineer needs to cover every single dimension, so don’t take this as a literal requirements checklist. We're excited to talk with you if you are interested in:</p><ul><li style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">Building production-hardened web services, with consideration for security, performance, scalability, reliability, and repeatability.</li><li style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">Creating APIs that are composable to solve many different needs.</li><li style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">Rapid prototyping new product concepts, especially for enterprise clients.</li><li style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">Automated test in web apps.</li><li>Database fundamentals and practical applications of them.AWS cloud services as applied to healthcare problems</li></ul><h4>TECHNOLOGIES USED AT NUNA</h4><ul><li style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">Python, Django, SQL/SQLAlchemy, OpenAP, testing tools (e.g. pytest), Gitlab</li><li style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">Linux, OS X&nbsp;</li><li style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">AWS ECS, RDS, EMR, IAM, Hashicorp Terraform and Vault</li></ul><p><em>Nuna is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.
