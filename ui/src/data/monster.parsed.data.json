        "description": "We're looking for Ph.D. candidates to intern during summer 2021 (12 weeks). You will be embedded in a team and work closely with other data scientists, engineers, and product managers under the supervision of a data scientist on that team. <p><b>About the Role</b></p><p>We are hiring interns to work on the Global Marketing, Policy Economics, and Core Analytics &amp; Science teams. Read on to learn more about these three teams.</p><p>(1) <b>Marketing</b> data science informs decisions across Uber's global marketing efforts, accelerating both demand and supply growth worldwide. We leverage advanced statistical modeling, machine learning, or data mining techniques in a scalable manner including large scale data processing such as Spark, Hive, and Uber's proprietary machine learning platform, and more. Interns on the team will work on projects such as: </p><p> • Assisting in prototyping causal inference methods and econometric models to inform the efficiency of our marketing spend<br> • Building propensity models to aid in the growth and profitability of different Uber products (Uber Rides Pass, Eats pass, etc.)<br> • Architecting a recommendation system to understand cuisine preferences at a user-level<br> • Standardizing marketing models and enhancing their scalability and stability through platformization</p><p>• Identifying and implementing improvements to our bid, budget and creative optimization algorithms on Uber's advertising channels like Google, Facebook, etc.</p><p>(2) The <b>Policy Economics</b> team conducts research that forms the foundation for business decisions and our policy positions and helps policymakers, thought leaders, and the general public gain a better understanding of our platform. This team sits under the Policy, Research and Economics team; led by the Chief Economist, we are responsible for addressing the thorny policy and business challenges impacting Uber globally. As a data scientist intern on this team, you would be expected to bring analytical and empirical rigor to bear on important questions relating to the changing nature of work and the economics of marketplaces.</p><p>(3) The <b>Core Analytics &amp; Science </b>(CAS) team covers both of Uber's main lines of business as well as the underlying platform technologies that power those businesses. We are a key part of Uber's cross-functional product development teams, helping to drive every stage of product development through data analytic, statistical, and algorithmic expertise. Here are the subteams within CAS that make it happen:</p><p> • <b>Eats:</b> Uber Eats is Uber's ambitious and rapidly growing on-demand food delivery business currently operating in over 45 countries globally and is the largest outside of China. Eat is a 3-sided marketplace, comprising Eaters, Delivery Partners, and Restaurants. Eats interns will work on exciting and impactful projects that advance our algorithms and discover insights to improve engagement with eaters, merchants, and couriers. Projects include optimizing our eater pricing systems and routing algorithms, modeling and predicting eater and courier behavior on the platform, and improving the efficiency of user acquisition, promotions, courier experience, and merchant onboarding.<br> • <b>Rides</b>: Rides Data Science at Uber uses data to improve and automate Uber's core ridesharing products. Rides interns will tackle problems such as optimizing Uber's short and long term pricing systems; efficiently matching incoming trip requests in Uber's dispatch system; developing innovative incentive schemes that reward riders and drivers for choosing our network; optimizing pickup and dropoff experiences for both riders and drivers, and developing algorithms and experimentation to make our rider and driver user experience stand out. We also forecast, monitor, and evaluate all aspects of our marketplace and user behavior using both large scale observational data and meticulous experimentation.<br> • <b>Platform:</b> Platform Data Science develops the common systems and technical foundations that power Uber's trip experiences externally and core decision making systems internally. Interns on the Platform team will work on building statistical, machine learning, and optimization models for problems like travel time estimation, route optimization, search personalization, and ranking.</p><p><b>What You'll Do</b></p><p> • Work with your mentor closely to scope a project, define the problem, and develop and prototype the solution using data-driven approaches<br> • Work with engineers and product managers to turn data science prototypes into robust, reliable solutions<br> • Present findings to business leaders to inform decisions<br> • Establish standard methodologies for data science including modeling, coding, analytics, optimization, and experimentation<br> • Conduct experiments to advise product decisions</p><p><b>Basic Qualifications</b></p><p> • Current Ph.D. student majoring in Computer Science, Economics, Statistics, Machine Learning, Operations Research, or other quantitative fields<br> • Knowledge of underlying mathematical foundations of statistics, machine learning, optimization, economics, and analytics<br> • Experience with exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, testing, and model development<br> • Proficiency in languages like SQL, R, and Python</p><p><b>Preferred Qualifications </b></p><p> • Anticipated graduation between winter 2021-summer 2022<br> • Ability to communicate effectively with both technical and business partners<br> • Research mentality with a bias towards action to structure a project from idea to experimentation to prototype to implementation<br> • Experience in experimental design and analysis (e.g., A/B and market-level experiments), as well as causal inference<br> • Independence, excellent communication, and outstanding follow-through - you energetically tackle your work and love the responsibility of being individually empowered</p><p>At Uber, we ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion. We take on big problems to help drivers, riders, delivery partners, and eaters get moving in more than 600 cities around the world.</p><p>We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build a future where everyone and everything can move independently. If you have a curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let's move the world forward, together.</p><p>Uber is proud to be an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, color, religion, national origin, disability, protected veteran status, age, or any other characteristic protected by law. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements.</p><p>If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation, please let us know by completing (this form)(https://forms.gle/aDWTk9k6xtMU25Y5A).\n      \n          <a href=\"https%3A%2F%2Fars2.equest.com%2F%3Fresponse_id%3De7bbe41a902a54aec579fe415478b07e\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>",

Furthermore, employees in New Mexico need to pass a U.S. Air Force background screen for access to Kirtland Air Force Base.

The UPIV process will include the completion of a USAccess Enrollment, SF-85 (Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions) and OF-306 (Declaration of for Federal Employment). An unfavorable UPIV determination will result in immediate retrieval of the SNL issued badge, removal of cyber (logical) access and/or removal from SNL subcontract. &nbsp;All MOWs may appeal the unfavorable UPIV determination to DOE/NNSA immediately. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the MOW may try to go through the UPIV process one year after the decision date.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><h2>EEO</h2><div><div><div>&nbsp;</div><p>All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status and any other protected class under state or federal law.</p></div></div></div></div></div>",
