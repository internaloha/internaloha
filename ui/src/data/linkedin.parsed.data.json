It’s the only platform that truly unifies every employee system, and automates all of the administrative work.<br><br>Rippling is headquartered in San Francisco and has raised over $200M from top-tier investors, including Founders Fund, Greenoaks Capital, Coatue Management, Kleiner Perkins, and YCombinator.<br><br><strong><u>About The Role<br><br></u></strong>We are looking for highly motivated students to join our team for internships beginning in September 2021. As an intern, you will work on a real project (or a few) and have an opportunity to enjoy our fast paced and innovative environment. You will get the opportunity to build products and features that fulfill our mission; free smart people to work on hard problems.<br><br><strong><u>About Our Teams<br><br></u></strong>Insurance Team<br><br>The insurance team builds the product that manages all aspects of the insurance benefits that a company provides to its employees. It covers medical, dental, vision. long terms disability, short term disability, life, FSA, HSA, Cobra, Commuter, and ACA , etc. It has an admin portal and employee facing app. It is an important piece of the product line in Rippling's offering. We are also a platform where other broker channels can use our platform to manage benefits for their corporate clients.<br><br><strong>Device Team<br><br></strong>The Device Management product enables IT admins to secure and manage company devices and data effortlessly. When a customer hires a new employee, Rippling ships them a laptop that is preconfigured with the new employee's user account, all of the company's security settings, and any software the new employee needs. This makes onboarding easy for new hires, and saves hours of an IT admin's time. Our device management team is building out an entire product vertical that competes against multi-billion dollar incumbents like Jamf -- and by building our device management product on top of an employee system of record, we're able to build better automation and outcompete those standalone device management products.<br><br>The tech stack on the device management team is broader than most other teams within Rippling. In addition to full-stack web development in Python and Javascript, the device team also runs Chef and Ruby on managed devices, with a lot of Bash and Powershell to interact with the OS, and infrastructure to manage clusters of devices across Linux, Mac, and Windows.<br><br><strong>Identity Team<br><br></strong>Our Identity product automates the management of employee accounts in 400+ cloud services. When one of our customers hires an employee, our system automatically creates the employee's accounts in G Suite, Slack, Dropbox, GitHub, AWS, etc, adds the user to the right groups and permissions, and allows the employee to sign in to those services using SAML or RPass -- Rippling's end-to-end encrypted password manager. We work closely with our integration partners and our business development team to build new integrations, manage our existing partnerships, and most importantly, build an integration ecosystem that is a key long term moat for Rippling's business.<br><br><strong>HRIS Team<br><br></strong>The <strong>Human Resource Information Systems (</strong>HRIS) team is responsible for building products for employee lifecycle management, employee experience management, compliance management, documents management and talent management. Each product as a stand-alone is part of a multi-billion dollar market.<br>Engineers working on this team will get to develop products that are used by Rippling customers and internal engineering teams, they will work on scaling the existing products, help in reducing latency and in making the products more secure.<br><br><strong>Platform Team<br><br></strong>The platform team builds both the product and technology foundations of Rippling. We’re responsible for the core service framework, permissioning, and any other core technologies needed to write backend code at Rippling.<br><br>We’re also responsible for core product platforms like data reporting products, workflows, search, and RQL (Rippling Query Language), which are both external and internal facing.
