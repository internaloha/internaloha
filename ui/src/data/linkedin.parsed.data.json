L’Oréal, Staples, Mastercard, and other leading innovators use Ironclad to collaborate and negotiate on contracts, accelerate contracting while maintaining compliance, and turn contracts into critical carriers of operational business intelligence. It’s the only platform flexible enough to handle every type of contract workflow, whether a sales agreement, an HR agreement or a complex NDA. The company was named one of the 20 Rising Stars on the Forbes 2019 Cloud 100 list, and is backed by leading investors like Accel, Y Combinator, Sequoia, and Bond. For more information, visit www.ironcladapp.com or follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.<br><br>Contracts are the atomic unit of business - everything important that a company does involves a contract: sales, purchases, hires, everything. The process for making a contract happen isn’t that different from the software lifecycle: a cross functional group collaborates on a technical document that essentially needs to be executable - just in a courtroom instead of a computer. Most legal teams are still stuck doing things manually, emailing versions of these documents around seeking approval and revisions with no easy way to automate workflows. Simple questions like “what is blocking this contract?” can be really difficult to answer since the information is locked in someone’s inbox.<br><br>As an Engineering Intern, you'll be working across the team to identify business problems and design, build and verify solutions.

You'll be doing professional level work that will have a real impact on the business</li> <li>Training.

In addition from the support from your team you'll be assigned a Mentor outside of your department who will guide you and mentor you throughout the summer</li> <li>End of summer presentation.

That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance.

Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.<br><br><strong><em>What else you should know: <br></em></strong><ul> <li>We're a publicly-traded company (TREE).</li> <li>We've welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.</li> <li>We've built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health. </li> <li>We still make funny commercials.</li> <br></ul><strong>CULTURE<br><br></strong>We're a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We're collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you'll ever work with.

We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions. </li><li> More Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example: </li><li> Our Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job. </li><li> Our Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food. </li></ul> For our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base.<br><ul><li> More Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships. <br></li></ul><strong> Our Commitment to Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, Belonging <br><br></strong><strong>We Are Therefore Committed To Building And Nurturing a Culture Of Diversity, Inclusion, And Belonging By<br><br></strong>Together we can foster true belonging.We know different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds lead to better innovation and results.<br><ul><li> Welcoming people of different backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations; </li><li> Empowering our people to share their experiences and ideas through open forums and individual conversations; and </li><li> Valuing each person’s unique perspectives and individual contributions. <br></li></ul>Embracing diversity enables our people to “make the difference” at FLEETCOR.<br><br><strong> Our Values<br><br></strong><strong>Our Entrepreneurial Spirit Remains Strong Across Our Global Workforce, And We Reinforce These Principles In Our Five Core Values<br><br></strong>FLEETCOR’s culture reflects our history of fast growth and our continued drive for results.<br><ul><li> Innovation: Figure out a better way </li><li> Execution: Get it done quickly </li><li> Integrity: Do the right thing </li><li> People: We make the difference </li><li> Collaboration: Accomplish more together <br></li></ul>These values guide all of our employees and are infused in all aspects of our Company. We are, as a team, united through these shared values and our mission to provide “a better way to pay.”<br><br>Our values foster an inclusive culture through the expectation that all employees will treat each other with respect and appreciate the diversity of identities, thoughts, backgrounds and styles. Our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture has never been more essential than in this moment of national reflection.We must always celebrate the diversity of our company and our communities.<br><br>We strongly believe that the quality and diversity of our workforce provide FLEETCOR with a competitive advantage, and that our problem-solving and solution-building efforts are greatly enhanced when we harness the collective thinking of a diverse group of people with unique experiences and perspectives.<br><br><strong>FLEETCOR’s COVID-19 Hiring Guidelines<br><br></strong>Due to COVID-19, most of our employees are temporarily working from home. In addition, FLEETCOR implemented a virtual interviewing and hiring process, engaging with talent by phone or video and onboarding new employees remotely. We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together.<br><br><strong>Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer<br><br></strong>FLEETCOR is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

        "description": "When you think about your last doctor’s appointment, how much do you actually recall? If you’re like most people, you’ll likely forget over 40% of the conversation. Details fall through the cracks, generic printouts you receive end up in the trash, and important information never makes it to other doctors. Ultimately, you’re left needing to connect the dots in your care. That’s why we started Abridge with a simple thesis: if we can shift agency to consumers, we can help them stay on top of their health. When you use Abridge to record your health conversations, the conversations themselves become your medical record. It’s as easy as that.<br><br>We are looking for research interns to working on exciting NLP challenges using our large annotated proprietary healthcare datasets. You will be able to create/customize your internship research statement and collaborate with our in-house Machine Learning research team. At the end of the internship, you will also have the opportunity to publish your work at top tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, NAACL, and ACL.<br><br>The goal of the internship is to advance the state-of-the-art in one or many of the following research areas:<br><br><li> Dialog Understanding</li><li> Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling</li><li> Clinical Natural Language Processing</li><li> Information Extraction</li><li> Machine Learning using Ontologies or Knowledge graphs<br><br></li><strong> Required Qualification <br><br></strong><li> Must be accepted to or currently enrolled in an MS or Ph.D. program in Computer Science or a related field</li><li> Must have at least one NLP machine learning paper submitted or published</li><li> Experience in utilizing theoretical and empirical research to solve problems</li><li> Ability to communicate complex research ideas in a clear, precise, and actionable manner</li><li>Research internships are offered year-round with flexible durations<br><br></li><strong> Compensation <br></strong><ul><li>$80,000-$100,000 per year</li></ul>Life at Abridge<br><br>At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.<br><br>Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and believe that \"you need to taste good things to have good taste.\"<br><br>Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do.
