Founded in 1996, the network has 65 Country Water Partnerships and 13 Regional Water Partnerships. GWP's vision is a water secure world. To realise this vision GWP supports countries to advance governance and management of water resources for sustainable and equitable development. This is pursued by promoting Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), a cross-sectoral policy approach designed to replace the traditional, fragmented sectoral approach that has led to poor services and unsustainable resource use. As a means to achieving long-term impact towards water security, GWP seeks to influence water governance processes through the promotion of IWRM principles. Policy development, strategic planning, legislative change, investment planning and transboundary agreements are examples of such processes and it is here that GWP actively contributes both inside and outside the 'water box' at the global, regional, national and subnational levels.</p><p><br></p><p>The GWP Secretariat supports Regional Water Partnerships and Country Water Partnerships to carry out their work programmes, as well as to facilitate knowledge sharing across countries and regions. This support is delivered in the context of GWP's three anchor areas within the GWP Strategy 2020-2025:</p><p><br></p><p>1.&nbsp;Water Solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals<br>2.&nbsp;Climate Resilience through Water<br>3.&nbsp;Transboundary Water Cooperation</p><p><br></p><p>This internship offers an excellent opportunity for students interested in sustainable development and water governance to gain exposure to the operations of a network organization that extends from the global level to regional and national levels.</p><p><br></p><p>Main Tasks</p><p><br></p><p>The intern will be part of the Water Solutions for the SDGs team in the Network Operations Unit, supporting thematic work on food and ecosystems, and supporting regional SDG 6.5.1 activities through the GWP network.
