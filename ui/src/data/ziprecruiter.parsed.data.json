        "description": "<div><p>Data Scientist Intern Fall Internship (August 2021 - December, full-time work schedule, Monday- Friday 40 hours per week) Meraki is making IT easier, faster, and smarter. As a business unit of Cisco Systems, Meraki is the fastest growing cloud-managed networking team in the world with products and technology architecture that are changing the face of enterprise networking and making cloud-managed IT a reality. At Cisco Meraki, we're on track to be the most successful acquisition in Cisco's history (and certainly the most fun). </p><p>Our office makes working here pretty special too. If you're looking for a company that really commits, how about our onsite gym with weekly fitness and yoga classes, and paid time off to volunteer and give back to the community? All in all, what truly makes Meraki special are the people - people who keep the culture strong and make working here exciting, meaningful, and rewarding. </p><p>As a Data Science intern, you will be a key partner in Meraki's data ecosystem, responsible for analyzing operational data to build predictive models that drive key decisions for Meraki's internal operations teams. At Meraki, we have business problems that require us to apply machine learning and pattern recognition against large scale datasets of operational and machine-generated data. We're looking for help in solving them. </p><p>As part of this role, you will develop relationships across Meraki's teams such as support, operations, business operations, and product. Ideal candidates will have an analytical mindset, mathematical, and programming skills, and a bias for action. You don't wait for change - you embody the change you want to see in the world! </p><p>EXAMPLE PROJECTS OF A DATA Scientist: Analyze network logs over time to recognize performance issues. Can we build a machine learning model to sift through live log streams and proactively detect issues? How do we use historical data to accelerate sales growth? </p><p>Can we predict which Meraki partners are likely to grow their business over a certain period? How can we use ML to optimize hardware inventory levels? Can we forecast product demand on a monthly basis a year out? </p><p> How can we optimize the rollout of a new product? Can we calculate the probability of product acquisition for each of our customers with no historical sales data? MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS: Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in computer science, engineering, economics, finance, or a technical (STEM) field An understanding of machine learning algorithms and basic statistical concepts (e.g. </p><p>correlation, causation, regression analysis) Proficiency in SQL and python programming Ability to take initiative and work autonomously Strong analytical and critical thinking skills INTERN PROGRAM OVERVIEW: Meraki interns join the team for a 12-week program and are placed directly onto subteams. During the program, interns have the opportunity to work on various projects, such as integration and implementation of new tools. Projects are cross functional, which allow insight into new languages and technologies, help encourage professional growth within engineering, strategy, and support, and allow a sense of ownership within the team. </p><p>Meraki's teams place a high emphasis on mentorship. Each intern is matched 1:1 with a mentor who provides continual feedback and guidance throughout the duration of the program. Mentors help with introductions to other team members, overviews of tools and processes, and provide a seamless integration into Meraki life. </p><p>Cisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis. Cisco will consider for employment, on a case by case basis, qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records. At Cisco Meraki, we're challenging the status quo with the power of diversity, inclusion, and collaboration. </p><p>When we connect different perspectives, we can imagine new possibilities, inspire innovation, and release the full potential of our people. We're building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.</p></div>",
