In 2016, AIG created a “Legacy” portfolio as a separate non-core segment representing insurance reserves associated with discontinued lines of commercial Property &amp; Casualty and Life &amp; Annuity insurance businesses. The following year, AIG formed a Bermuda-domiciled composite reinsurer, now Fortitude Re, to house the Legacy portfolio in a separate, distinct, well-capitalized balance sheet with a dedicated management team. In 2018, the company entered into a series of L&amp;A and P&amp;C reinsurance transactions with AIG and received an initial capitalization of ~$3 BN. The transactions represented ~$37 BN of reserves supported by ~$40 BN of invested assets. During this time, AIG also entered into a long-term partnership with The Carlyle Group, with Carlyle acquiring 19.9 % ownership. Then in 2019, The Carlyle Group and T&amp;D announced acquisition of majority interest in Fortitude Re from AIG. This allowed for a new long-term shareholder base for the company while maintaining a strong capital position for supporting reinsurance obligations.
