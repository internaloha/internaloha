        "description": "<div><div><p>We are looking for a summer intern to investigate and develop automated methods for characterizing the security of applications that are developed using continuous development (DevSecOps)!</p><p>\nThis task includes security profiling during code production, integration, testing, delivery, and assessment. You will learn to determine the security profile of applications by processing the language that describes tasks and functions that get implemented in the software modules. Such descriptions are typically available from project lifecycle management platforms such as Jira or Gitlab. Given the variety of methods to define application functionality, you will deal with code descriptions presented in natural language, as well as in structured and semi-structured formats. Hence, you will get an opportunity to execute tools for Natural Language Processing and static code analysis. You will build additional tools to generate security code policy description files in a standard format (e.g., JSON).</p><p>\nThe internship will focus mostly on network communication, i.e., the policy files will contain list of servers that need to be accessed by each software module, network communication flows (i.e., network ports, addresses, protocols) established towards other resources or peer nodes, business or domain-specific process flows followed by the clients and servers, and edge cases for communications that might incur during code maintenance processes.</p><p>\nFurthermore, you will build a mechanism to use the policy files above as a descriptor to configure a network flow monitor installed on the same network as the profiled application. The goal of the project is to improve automating the steps required for DevSecOps by adopting a fine-grained characterization of software modules. This will increase awareness of security during code production.</p><br>\n<b>The Challenge</b>\n<ul><li>Install and maintain a DevOps testbed for testing based on Jira and Gitlab, and a sample open application under development</li><li>\nDevelop methods to access the APIs of Project Lifecycle Management (APM) platforms, e.g., Jira REST API</li><li>\nUse the APIs to extract code descriptions and collect them in a database, reporting versioning, bugs, fixes, snippets and analytics</li><li>\nDetermine and understand methods to characterize the code and textual descriptions, using tools such as SrcML</li><li>\nBuild tools to generate code behavior descriptor files using JSON</li><li>\nCreate an interface to command a network monitor based on the file JSON above</li><li>\nInstall a code execution and monitoring testbed, running a network monitor<br>\n</li></ul>\n<b>The Candidate</b>\n<ul><li>A current student pursuing a MS/PhD degree in Computer Science / Computer Engineering, or other related subject with a strong focus on IT-Security or Cybersecurity.

US Export Control laws and applicable regulations govern the distribution of strategically important technology, services and information to foreign nationals and foreign countries. Siemens may require candidates under consideration for employment opportunities to submit information regarding citizenship status to allow the organization to comply with specific US Export Control laws and regulations.

With a world-wide perpetual software license in place with Avidyne that covers $100M in aviation technology IP, expertise in aviation system certification, and a growing customer set, Autonodyne will develop, and if desired by the customer, certify systems and software for civil and defense aircraft that operate without a traditional pilot. While there are many companies providing products and services to the growing UAS market, we already have all of the necessary building blocks and move at higher clock speeds than the competition and are unique in that we are also experts in national and international certification which allows these products to be flown anywhere. Autonodyne is located in Boston, Massachusetts (and has a presence in Concord MA, Burlington MA, Dayton OH, Colorado Springs CO, and greater Los Angeles CA) and is looking for engineers who are interested in swarm/network topologies, artificial intelligence algorithms and the UAS/UAV/Unmanned space. This position reports to the Vice President, Engineering.<br>This is a paid internship position. Timing of the internship is flexible – it may run during the summer months or academic year, or both.<br>Position Summary:<br>As a software engineering intern, your principal work assignments will involve investigating various network topologies that will enable unmanned aerial vehicles. Often described as a swarm, Autonodyne is looking at optimum architectures for airborne vehicles. You will encode one or more algorithms for integration into simulation environments, and if the customer timing works out, potentially install that code onto actual flight platforms.<br>This work would be integrated with the Autonodyne mission computer software and control station software and the various augmented reality devices we are working with for control of the formation/swarm.<br>The Autonodyne products are currently a mix of existing product sets and many that are under development or haven’t started yet. We place a strong emphasis on graphical user interfaces (GUI) and natural user interfaces (NUI) along with high levels of autonomy and artificial intelligence.<br>We will be a focused team of engineers principally based in the Boston area working on a number of rapid-paced, high-energy programs.

At that point, we’ve become so knowledgeable in the field that we know which company most needs our services and the expected return a partnership will create for them.<br>*<br>*<br>Our Values</p><p>Think strategically</p><p>Set goals</p><p>Outwork everyone</p><p>Collaborate honestly</p><p>Celebrate often<br>*<br>*<br>Internship Description</p><p>The Marketing Internship at Accelerant Agency requires a growth-focused mindset and a desire to think strategically. The primary focus of this role is to give interns the opportunity to learn new skills in evolving markets and put them into practice.<br>*</p><p>*<br>What you’ll do</p><p>In the same way we adjust to our Chicagoland clients, this internship will flex to the current and desired skillset of our intern.

On any given week, though, you might expect to work on projects like:<br>*</p><p>*</p><ul><li>Web Design and development -- Whether you can hand-code or don’t even know what HTML stands for, you’ll likely learn website design 101. Accelerant’s founder has built websites for more than 20 years, and prides himself on breaking down the tech barrier to give interns a basic understanding of taking an idea from concept to public.</li></ul><ul><li>SEO and copywriting -- It’s not as daunting as it may seem.

In this internship, you’ll learn first-hand from someone with a decade-plus experience in conversion rate optimization, a highly desired skill in today’s workplace.</li></ul><ul><li>Business intelligence and competitive analysis -- Yup. You’ll learn this in an internship. Accelerant has developed a process to identify a company’s growth potential on multiple digital platforms. You’ll learn how to spot a company’s blind spots online, and how to create opportunities to address those blind spots using enterprise-level software, tools and techniques.</li></ul><ul><li>Google Analytics and Google Ads optimization -- Google owns the internet, for better or worse. An Accelerant intern will become well-versed on all of Google’s products, including Analytics, Ads, Search Console, Tag Manager and others.</li></ul><p>*<br>*<br>Qualifications</p><ul><li>Experience in WordPress design or WordPress development</li><li>Basic understanding of digital marketing</li></ul><ul><li>Desire to pursue a career in Web Design, Communications, Advertising, Sales, Journalism, Public Relations, Marketing, computer science, Information Technology, Internet Marketing, Data Analytics, Data Science or related fields</li></ul><ul><li>Growth-mindset and eagerness to learn</li></ul><ul><li>Ability to have a ton of fun while doing the above</li></ul><p>*<br>*<br>Perks + Pay</p><ul><li>Opportunity to work with industry professionals and experienced marketers</li></ul><ul><li>Ongoing training and personal instruction from Accelerant team members, partner creatives, and specialized online courses</li></ul><ul><li>Monthly stipend based on hours worked</li></ul><ul><li>Portfolio piece opportunities with real clients</li></ul><p>*</p><p>Job Types: Part-time, Temporary, Internship</p><p>Pay: $12.00 - $18.00 per hour</p><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Professional development assistance</li></ul><p>COVID-19 considerations:<br>Social distancing in place and required masks</p><p>Application Question(s):</p><ul><li>What is your process for website design and development?</li></ul><p>Education:</p><ul><li>High school or equivalent (Preferred)</li></ul><p>Experience:</p><ul><li>WordPress: 1 year (Preferred)</li></ul><p>Work Location:</p><ul><li>One location</li></ul><p>This Job Is Ideal for Someone Who Is:</p><ul><li>Dependable -- more reliable than spontaneous</li><li>Adaptable/flexible -- enjoys doing work that requires frequent shifts in direction</li><li>Achievement-oriented -- enjoys taking on challenges, even if they might fail</li></ul><p>Company's website:</p><ul><li>accelerantagency.com</li></ul><p>Work Remotely:</p><ul><li>Yes</li></ul><p>COVID-19 Precaution(s):</p><ul><li>Remote interview process</li><li>Personal protective equipment provided or required</li><li>Social distancing guidelines in place</li><li>Virtual meetings</li><li>Sanitizing, disinfecting, or cleaning procedures in place</li></ul>",

Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.<br>\n<br>\nDue regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs.

Are there easier ways to spend your summer? Absolutely. But a LendingTree Internship will help you grow professionally and also get you closer to landing a phenomenal job once you graduate – maybe even with LendingTree. Here’s what you can expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real work. The only person you’ll be getting coffee for at LendingTree is yourself. You’ll be doing professional level work that will have a real impact on the business</li>\n<li>Training. Sure you’ll learn a ton of industry skills as you contribute to your team every day, but you’ll also go through specific training on: crafting a phenomenal resume and LinkedIn profile, getting interviews and how to handle them, how to give a great presentation and more</li>\n<li>You’re not alone. In addition from the support from your team you’ll be assigned a Mentor outside of your department who will guide you and mentor you throughout the summer</li>\n<li>End of summer presentation. At the end of the summer every Intern gives a PPT presentation to Executives which will include a summary of what you accomplished, what you learned and 2 ideas that will either make the company money or save the company money</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>RESPONSIBILITIES</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Own a project – Analyze current customer experiences.

Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.</p>\n<p><b><i>\nWhat else you should know:</i></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re a publicly-traded company (TREE).</li>\n<li>We’ve welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.</li>\n<li>We’ve built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.</li>\n<li>We still make funny commercials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>CULTURE</b></p>\n<p>\nWe’re a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend.

Thank you.</b></p>\n<p>\nThis position will likely work remotely the entire summer. However, our preference is to hire someone who will be based in the Chicago, IL area on the chance we're able to go back to office during the summer.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\nTHE POSITION</b></p>\n<p>\nOur former Summer Interns will tell you, LendingTree’s Internship Program is selective, challenging and structured to push the limits of what they thought they could do - and they wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. Are there easier ways to spend your summer? Absolutely. But a LendingTree Internship will help you grow professionally and also get you closer to landing a phenomenal job once you graduate – maybe even with LendingTree. Here’s what you can expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real work. The only person you’ll be getting coffee for at LendingTree is yourself. You’ll be doing professional level work that will have a real impact on the business</li>\n<li>Training. Sure you’ll learn a ton of industry skills as you contribute to your team every day, but you’ll also go through specific training on: crafting a phenomenal resume and LinkedIn profile, getting interviews and how to handle them, how to give a great presentation and more</li>\n<li>You’re not alone. In addition from the support from your team you’ll be assigned a Mentor outside of your department who will guide you and mentor you throughout the summer</li>\n<li>End of summer presentation. At the end of the summer every Intern gives a PPT presentation to Executives which will include a summary of what you accomplished, what you learned and 2 ideas that will either make the company money or save the company money</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>RESPONSIBILITIES</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Own a project – Analyze current customer experiences. Define, and run A/B tests and optimize consumer web-based product to specific metrics.</li>\n<li>Monitor and analyze product performance and communicate findings and recommendations for meaningful changes. Define Product requirements for actionable changes and reiterate.</li>\n<li>Put together wireframes to support product requirements and changes to be done.</li>\n<li>Understand scope of the internal web-based product, participate in workshops. Own feature delivery, and write product requirements by working with business and development teams.</li>\n<li>Communicate to partners on the progress of the feature/functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>QUALIFICATIONS</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Undergrad or grad student (3.5+ GPA required) who will be graduating in Dec. 2021 or May 2022 (GPA must be listed on your resume to be considered).</li>\n<li>Preferred majors: Business, Information Technology, Computer Science.</li>\n<li>Proficient in Excel (Pivot Tables, VLOOKUPs, etc.) and SQL</li>\n<li>Good understanding of how APIs work.</li>\n<li>Knowledge of Agile/Scrum product development or software development methodologies is preferred.</li>\n<li>Willingness to roll up your sleeves and GET STUFF DONE.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>COMPANY</b></p>\n<p>\nLendingTree is the nation’s largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices. Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.</p>\n<p><b><i>\nWhat else you should know:</i></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re a publicly-traded company (TREE).</li>\n<li>We’ve welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.</li>\n<li>We’ve built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.</li>\n<li>We still make funny commercials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>CULTURE</b></p>\n<p>\nWe’re a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We’re collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you’ll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, <i>do</i> wear clothes to work!), and we’re pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, “Get Stuff Done”).
