We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.
