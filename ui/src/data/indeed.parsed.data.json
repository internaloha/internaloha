(“FLEETCOR”) is a leading global provider of business payment solutions.

We group our payment solutions into five primary categories: Fuel, Lodging, Tolls, Corporate Payments and Gift. Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics: customers are primarily businesses, have recurring revenue models, have specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high margins, and have similar selling systems.<br>\n</div><div><br>\nFLEETCOR enjoys global recognition including:\n</div><ul><li>Forbes Global Growth Champion – FLEETCOR is one of the 250 fastest growing companies in the world as determined by Forbes and Statista</li></ul><ul>\n<li>Forbes World’s Most Innovative Companies – FLEETCOR has made this prestigious list of leading innovative companies 4 years in a row!</li></ul><ul>\n<li>Fortune 1000 Company – FLEETCOR was one of the largest movers in the new rankings of the largest companies in America, ranking #872</li></ul><ul>\n<li>S&amp;P 500 – In 2018, FLEETCOR joined the S&amp;P stock index comprised of the 500 leading US stocks based on market cap (company value)\n</li></ul><div><b>Our Vision</b><b><br>\n</b></div><div>Despite many advances in our industry, the majority of business payments are still made with outdated and inferior payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a business world where every purchase is controlled, every payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with more time for what matters most: activities that grow their businesses.<br>\n</div><div><b>Our Mission</b><b><br>\n</b></div><div>FLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR.<b><br>\n</b></div><div><br>\n<b>Our Strategy</b><b><br>\n</b></div><div>FLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple three-prong strategy for growing our business:\n</div><ul><li>More Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions.</li></ul><ul>\n<li>More Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example:</li></ul><ul>\n<ul><li>Our Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job.</li></ul></ul><ul><ul>\n<li>Our Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food.</li></ul></ul><div><div>\nFor our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base.</div></div>\n<ul><li>More Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships.\n</li></ul><div><b>Our Commitment to Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, Belonging</b></div><div><b><br>\n</b></div><div>Together we can foster true belonging. We know different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds lead to better innovation and results. We are therefore committed to building and nurturing a culture of diversity, inclusion, and belonging by:\n</div><ul><li>Welcoming people of different backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations;</li></ul><ul>\n<li>Empowering our people to share their experiences and ideas through open forums and individual conversations; and</li></ul><ul>\n<li>Valuing each person’s unique perspectives and individual contributions.\n</li></ul><div>Embracing diversity enables our people to “make the difference” at FLEETCOR.</div><br>\n<div>\n<b>Our Values</b><b><br>\n</b></div><div>FLEETCOR’s culture reflects our history of fast growth and our continued drive for results. Our entrepreneurial spirit remains strong across our global workforce, and we reinforce these principles in our five core values:\n</div><ul><li>Innovation: Figure out a better way\n</li><li>Execution: Get it done quickly\n</li><li>Integrity: Do the right thing\n</li><li>People: We make the difference\n</li><li>Collaboration: Accomplish more together\n</li></ul><div>These values guide all of our employees and are infused in all aspects of our Company. We are, as a team, united through these shared values and our mission to provide “a better way to pay.”<br>\n</div><div>Our values foster an inclusive culture through the expectation that all employees will treat each other with respect and appreciate the diversity of identities, thoughts, backgrounds and styles. Our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture has never been more essential than in this moment of national reflection. We must always celebrate the diversity of our company and our communities.<br>\n</div><div>We strongly believe that the quality and diversity of our workforce provide FLEETCOR with a competitive advantage, and that our problem-solving and solution-building efforts are greatly enhanced when we harness the collective thinking of a diverse group of people with unique experiences and perspectives.<br>\n</div><div><b>FLEETCOR’s COVID-19 Hiring Guidelines:</b><b><br>\n</b></div><div>Due to COVID-19, most of our employees are temporarily working from home. In addition, FLEETCOR implemented a virtual interviewing and hiring process, engaging with talent by phone or video and onboarding new employees remotely.

Backblaze provides backup and cloud storage that’s astonishingly easy to use and inexpensive. Our customers use our services so they can pursue dreams like curing cancer (genome mapping is data intensive), archiving the work of some of the greatest artists on the planet (learn more about how Austin City Limits uses B2), or simply sleeping well at night (anyone that’s spilled a cup of coffee on a laptop knows the relief that comes with complete, secure backups). We are entrusted with almost an exabyte of data from customers in more than 175 countries. We exited 2020 growing quickly and cash flow positive, and we’ve done all this with just $3M of funding.</p>\n<p>We’ve managed to nurture a team oriented culture with amazingly low turnover.
