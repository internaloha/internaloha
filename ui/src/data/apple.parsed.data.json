To be successful, you need to have a strong technical foundation, ability to show initiative, learn new technologies quickly, and possess excellent interpersonal and communication skills. Ideal candidates are motivated and prepared to work independently. \n\nBelow are the various areas you can explore: \n\n<b>RTL Design:</b>You will help in the verification and lab bring-up of advanced mixed-signal circuits. Deep knowledge of chip architecture/microarchitecture, front end pre-silicon design flow, RTL design/coding, logic design, Verilog/System Verilog, low power design, timing/power/performance analysis, C/C++ \n\n<b>Design Verification:</b> In Design Verification, you will enable us to produce fully functional first silicon. Knowledge of chip architecture, Pre-silicon RTL design verification, System Verilog or UVM/OVM/VMM, block/chip/core test bench exp, System Verilog Assertion (SVA), C/C++/assembly, Perl/Python \n\n<b>Physical Design:</b> In Physical Design, you will be at the center of design effort collaborating with architecture, CAD, timing and logic design teams, with a critical impact on delivering best in class designs Knowledge of basic chip architecture, back end chip design flow, physical synthesis, floor-planning, place and route (PnR), power grid, timing (STA), physical design verification (DRC/LVS), EMIR (Redhawk/Totem/Voltus) \n\n<b>Modeling/Performance Engineer: </b>You will be focused on writing code for modeling and performance modeling for GPUs, CPUs, SoCs and other model infrastructure.

You'll be plugged into all tech nodes for chip delivery and be able to contribute on multiple projects. Must have excellent CAD flow programming and algorithm development knowledge. You will be collaborating with VLSI design and CAD teams, and EDA vendors to seek some of the most significant design problems. Strong analytical skills, effective communication and leadership qualities. \n\n<b>Signal Integrity/RF Engineer:</b> In RF Integrity, you will engage with cross-disciplinary teams to develop SoCs that will be used in Apple’s mobile devices. Specifically, responsibilities include developing novel methodology to solve very complex coupling issues, mitigating multi-radio coexistence problems at IC, package/module, and systems, as well as executing RF design integration topologies. Prior RF circuit design and EM modeling experience is highly preferred. \n\n<b>Embedded Engineer:</b> In Embedded Software Engineering, you will make up a significant portion of the Silicon Validation and Productization teams. Our embedded engineers develop, port, release, maintain, and enhance software to enable large scale testing of Apple’s SoCs. These engineers will integrate existing test software between environments, enhance test software to exercise functional blocks, develop Linux device drivers and user-land tests, implement device libraries to aid in the portability of device drivers, bring up low-level code on new SoCs and develop our own SMP RTOS. We have several types of embedded software engineers that focus on various aspects of the chip including feature validation (video, audio, display, etc.), IP validation, performance testing, micro-controller code, and low-level software. These engineers work in bare-metal, RTOS, and/or Linux environments to write software that runs on every Apple SoC in the design validation phase and downstream during manufacturing in the factory to identify bugs. C/C++ is the primary coding language (with some ARM Assembly) and Python is the primary scripting language. \n\n<b>Power/Battery Engineer: </b>In this role, you will be on the forefront of development bringing innovations in the industry Electronic circuit design/development experience for microcontroller-based systems. Knowledge of inter-module communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART, etc.) and familiarity of embedded systems. Prior experience in batteries, portable consumer electronics, Power Supplies, Medical Electronics, or automotive electronics. \n\n<b>Analog/Mixed Signal Engineer: </b>You will work closely with multi-functional teams with an understanding of design specs and requirements for analog mixed signal (AMS) circuits, including SerDes, PLLs &amp; Data Converters. Experience of designing AMS circuit blocks such as bandages, biasing circuits, LDO regulators, amplifiers, comparators, switched-cap circuits, ADCs, DACs, oscillators, filters. Device physics knowledge as it applies to analog IC design. \n\n<b>IC Packaging Engineer: </b>You will develop advanced packaging technologies for a multitude of projects including SoC’s Hands on experience with Cadence ADP/SIP. Familiarity with Signal and Power Integrity fundamentals. You'll be responsible for package/SIP layout, optimization, design verification and taping out. \n\n<b>Silicon Validation: </b>You will have the opportunity as either an embedded software engineer, high-speed board design engineer, or debug/triage engineer to work at the cross-section of hardware and software to perform silicon bring-up and system level validation of Apple’s SOCs. These teams build test software environments, debug tools, automated tests, and PCB boards that push functional blocks to their limits in order to root cause failures in the Silicon, identify fixes, and optimize performance and efficiency before we manufacture hundreds of millions of units. Knowledge of debug, silicon bring-up, chip architecture and design, embedded systems, C/C++/assembly, Python/Perl/Tcl. \n\n<b>Platform Engineer: </b>You will work as either an FPGA or Emulation engineer who build prototypes on FPGAs, build emulation models, and perform emulation on each yet-to-be-built chip with the primary goal of debugging. Knowledge of chip architecture and design, industry standard interfaces, FPGA tool flow, Verilog, C/C++/assembly, Python/Perl/Tcl, and debugging.</span>",
