Individuals from minority groups, indigenous groups and persons with disabilities are equally encouraged to apply. All applications will be treated with the strictest confidence.\n<br><br>\nUNDP does not tolerate sexual exploitation and abuse, any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.\n<br><br>\nBackground\n<br><br>\nReporting jointly to the Director of the Global Centre for Technology, Innovation and Sustainable Development and the Senior Principal Advisor for Small Island Developing States (SIDS), the intern will be joining an UNDP team developing a geospatial visualization and analysis web platform. The next phase of the platform will focus on the use of machine learning and other geospatial analytics tools to generate development insights for the SIDS. The intern is expected to support the platform through 1) development of a generic ML pipeline between the Azure backend and web frontend of the SIDS data platform 2) the development of a parametric ML model to extrapolate survey data to new spatial and temporal domains 3) support data management and geoprocessing functions in the cloud environment\n<br><br>\nUNDP works in some 170 countries and territories, helping to achieve the eradication of poverty, and the reduction of inequalities and exclusion. We help countries to develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities and build resilience in order to sustain development results. Inclusive growth, better services, environmental sustainability, good governance, and security are fundamental to development progress. We offer our expertise in development thinking and practice, and our decades of experience at country level, to support countries to meet their development aspirations and achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n<br><br>\nThe Global Centre for Technology, Innovation and Sustainable Development is a joint initiative by the Government of Singapore and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) which aims at identifying and co-creating technological solutions for sustainable development. The Centre curates partnerships, identifies solutions and connects partners and innovations with UNDP’s global network of Country Offices and development partners. UNDP has a large portfolio on digital transformation and digital solutions for sustainable development through the Global Centre for Technology, Innovation and Sustainable Development as well as strong focus on digital transformation under the policy advisory and programmatic focus on Small Island Developing States.\n<br><br>\nUNDP is committed to Small Island Developing States (SIDS), working to connect the UN global processes to regional and local development priorities and supporting and advocating for SIDS-specific development solutions. UNDP is committed to support SIDS through a global framework, consisting of three main pillars: Climate Action, Blue Economy and Digital Transformation. Through strategic partnerships and advocacy, UNDP aims to bridge gaps and create a network between SIDS and other key stakeholders. UNDP supports SIDS governments to build capacity — institutional, policy, technical — which enhances regional support the implementation of international normative standards and commitments in their own countries. With a broad country presence, UNDP has a major organizational investment and a multi-sectoral programme portfolio in SIDS. UNDP’s Bureau for Policy and Programme Support (BPPS) is responsible for developing all relevant policy and guidance to support the results of UNDP’s Strategic Plan. BPPS’s staff provides technical advice to Country Offices; advocates for UNDP corporate messages; represents UNDP at multi-stakeholder fora including public-private dialogues, government and civil society dialogues, South-South, SIDS-SIDS and Triangular cooperation initiatives; and engages in UN inter-agency coordination in specific thematic areas.\n<br><br>\nDuties and Responsibilities\n<br><br>\nThe intern is expected to support in the next phase of development of the SIDS data platform, specifically with cloud-based geospatial machine learning and analysis tools. The SIDS geospatial platform is designed to visualize and analyze the challenges and solutions for development in the SIDS. In addition to visualizing publicly available datasets, the platform will present specific geospatial studies being developed by UNDP and other UN agencies. Analysis tools are being developed extract insights from the geospatial datasets, such as correlation between datasets, identification of high-risk areas within countries, visualizing regional development potential in areas including food security, water, and energy access.\n<br><br>\nThe current phase of the platform is focused on developing a parametric machine learning interface that will leverage the compiled set of geospatial datasets in order to generate custom predictive maps. The architecture will build on work by Microsoft AI for Earth to create cloud infrastructures that retrain models quickly enough to allow parametric modeling to be conducted interactively in the browser. Using prebuilt models with custom parameters defined in the web interface, users will be able to test hypotheses using predictive climate modeling or extrapolate their sparse survey data into gridded geospatial models. The infrastructure will be scalability built in Azure to allow additional ML methods and models to be quickly integrated into the pipeline. A user of the SIDS GeoAI Interface will be able to connect their browser directly to a virtual GPU running all the models and geoprocessing functions. The frontend will be served the results, and end results will be displayed in the MapBox interface as well as available for export as geotiff files, along with analytics and accuracy metrics.\n<br><br>\n<b>The duties of the intern will involve:</b><br>\nDevelopment of a machine learning pipeline between the Azure backend and web frontend that can be used to integrate external machine learning models\n<br>Development of a parametric machine learning model to extrapolate survey data to new spatial and temporal domains\n<br>Support data management and geoprocessing functions in the cloud environment\n<br>Conduct geospatial machine learning research support on SIDS, particularly related to the thematic areas of climate action, blue economy and digital transformation;\n<br>Collaborate with UNDP’s data management team to build the database of SIDS geospatial datasets\n<br>Support the SIDS portfolios’ and efforts of the Global Centre for Technology, Innovation and Sustainable Development on an ad hoc basis as tasks arise.\n<br><br>\nCompetencies\n<br><br>\nDemonstrates integrity by modeling the UN's values and ethical standards;\n<br>Displays cultural, gender, religion, race, nationality and age sensitivity and adaptability;\n<br>Treats all people fairly without favoritism.\n<br>Strong organizational, analytical, reporting and writing abilities;\n<br>Strong data analysis and visualization skills;\n<br>Results driven, able to meet targets/deadlines;\n<br>Capacity to plan, prioritize and deliver tasks on time;\n<br>Creative thinking ability;\n<br>Highly organized and an ability to work independently;\n<br>Excellent analytical, writing and communication skills;\n<br>Openness to change and ability to receive/integrate feedback.\n<br><br>\nRequired Skills and Experience\n<br><br>\n<b>Experience:</b><br>\nExperience training, validating, and deploying geospatial machine learning models\n<br><br>\nGood knowledge of regression methods, deep learning, computer vision\n<br><br>\nExperience working with Azure or comparable cloud computing services\n<br><br>\nExperience deploying ML algorithms to virtual environments and server-side architectures\n<br><br>\nExperience with a GIS software such as QGIS, or ArcGIS, or ESRI\n<br><br>\nFluency in Python and ML libraries, and experience in PostgreSQL, PostGIS,\n<br><br>\nFamiliarity with publicly available geospatial datasets\n<br><br>\nVoluntary / internship experience in conducting research in international development or related field\n<br><br>\nAn understanding of development issues pertaining to SIDS is an advantage;\n<br><br>\nGood knowledge of United Nations System is desirable\n<br><br>\nWritten and spoken proficiency in English is a prerequisite.\n<br><br>\n<b>Field of studies:</b><br>\nMachine Learning, Data Science, Geography, Geographic Information Systems, Cloud Computing, GIS Solutions Architect, Geospatial Intelligence, Cartography, Computer Science, or related fields.\n<br><br>\n<b>Education:</b><br>\nInterns are selected on a competitive basis.

The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship.
