The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship.

When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.\n<br><br>\nJob Description\n<br><br>\nSquare's Hardware Team builds the tangible connection to Square. We started with a simple Reader that turns any phone or tablet into a mobile point of sale - and we continue to lead this category with advances in technologies that define point of sale hardware (NFC, display, WiFi, Bluetooth, touch). Our hardware engineers design and develop outstanding hardware products.
