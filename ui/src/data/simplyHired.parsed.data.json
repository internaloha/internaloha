We’re known for providing marketing, printing, websites and strategic guidance to thousands of brands, businesses and nonprofits. Our clients and partners count on us as a force in our areas of expertise to help them do more good.\n<br><br>\nSee if this position sounds like your dream job. We can’t wait to find out if it could be you.\n<br><br>\nJob Description\n<br><br>\nHow do you know if you're a perfect fit for our technology team? You simply love technology and you are phenomenal at helping others with their problems. You get giddy at the thought of tearing apart a computer to figure out why it won’t boot. You love it when your friends and family members ask you to help them with their computer problems. In fact, you’d probably be a little hurt if they didn’t.\n<br><br>\nAs a member of Firespring’s IT Team, you’ll be in great hands, being mentored by individuals who view technology and innovation as their passions. You will work closely with all departments across the company finding innovative ways for our employees to solve their technological problems and work more efficiently. At Firespring, IT is about more than installing software and fixing error messages. We love to find new and creative ways to solve our company’s technical challenges and we promise that every day will present you with a new puzzle.\n<br><br>\nStill interested? Read on.\n<br><br>\nQualifications\n<br><br>\nWe’re looking for candidates with experience in some or all of the following disciplines:\n<br><br>\n<b>Networking:</b> Firewall configuration/concepts, VLANs, Trunking 802.1 q, etc\n<br><br>\n<b>SaaS software and Cloud IT deployment and support:</b><br>\nG Suite, o365, Slack, Salesforce, SAML integration, etc.\n<br><b>Microsoft:</b> Active Directory/Group Policy, CIFS, MSSQL system administration\n<br><b>Scripting:</b> Powershell, Bash, VBScript, Python\n<br><br>\nTasks and Responsibilities\n<br><br>\nAs the newest member of Firespring’s IT team, you will work closely with our finance team and across all departments to design, architect, build and support a system for automating expense management in our company. You will be responsible for researching different solutions, putting together a business case for management which includes an explanation of ROI, budget, supportability, business continuity, and scalability. You will also be responsible for working across all departments in the company to roll out the approved solution to have a major, long-term effect on Firespring’s productivity and profitability. Additional responsibilities will be helping Firespring Team members with generalized computer assistance and troubleshooting, assisting our Help Desk and identifying ways that Firespring can improve its internal technology systems.\n<br><br>\n<b>Preferred Qualifications:</b><br>\nPursuing a Bachelor’s or Associate’s Degree in Computer Science or Engineering, Information Systems, or a related field.\n<br>Two or more semesters of related technology coursework.\n<br>Strong oral and written communication skills.\n<br><br>\nCompensation and Benefits\n<br><br>\nSalary—Hourly, we like to take care of our interns and your parents will like that you don’t need to hit them up…as much.\n<br>Hours—20-40 hours/week, flexible\n<br>Fun—Millions of people go to work, punch the clock from 8 to 5 and hate every moment of it—that’s not the case here. We have an indoor slide, a game room that includes shuffleboard, a pool table, a foosball table, a Ping Pong table and more. To put it mildly, we’re serious about having fun.\n<br>Miscellaneous Benefits—Not all benefits are about the Benjamins, baby. Some of the things you’ll enjoy while working here include unlimited soda, tea and beer (of course only if of age). And don’t worry about your duds—casual is the dress code here. Still looking to make your cubicle-shackled intern friends jealous of your new gig? Our company-wide social and recreational activities are sure to do just that.\n<br><br>\nReady to come aboard?\n<br><br>\nPlease include a cover letter. Resumes without one won't be considered. Seriously.\n<br><br>\nWhile we genuinely appreciate your interest in employment with Firespring, we can only respond to the most qualified candidates.\n<br><br>\nFirespring is an EEO/AA employer.</div><div></div>",
