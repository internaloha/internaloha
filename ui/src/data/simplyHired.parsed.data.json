During this 5-month program, you’ll build your logistics coordination and event management skills, build your portfolio with tangible projects, and create relationships with industry peers.</p><p>The position will report to the Podcast Host, Saya’Ka, or Webinar Manager Kalin Brown and work in conjunction with WRF’s social media team. This position requires a minimum of 5 months and 10-15 hours per week. During the program, interns will join weekly team meetings and will be given bi-weekly readings and assignments.</p><p>About WRF</p><p>We Roam Freely Inc. is a non-profit organization that works to uplift WOC and non-binary artists of color by prioritizing accessible showcasing, unrestrictive grants, immersive residencies, and intentional conversations. Founded in April 2019, WRF has organized two in-person art shows, a virtual showcase and panel discussion, and various community events and collaborations. Our events provide staffing opportunities for BIPOC communities as well as spotlight WOC and BIPOC artists without collecting a commission. Our focus in 2021 is to increase brand acquisition, develop new partnerships with like-minded individuals and organizations, meet our funding goals, and meaningfully impact the careers of BIPOC artists.</p><p>About the Podcast: The Need to Know</p><p>Our host Saya'ka unpacks the stories of uniquely talented BIPOC creatives, how they got to where they are and overcame the obstacles of being an artist. As we dive deep into the journies of our guests, we learn about navigating barriers, overcoming fear and self-doubt, and get vulnerable while sharing things we wish we knew when we were younger. Season 2 of the podcast begins in just a few months and we are taking a more thoughtful and intentional approach by incorporating musical performers, spoken word, and poetry. Our conversations will challenge the way we look at the art industry and perhaps ourselves.</p><p>About the Webinar: How to Roam Freely</p><p>The first season of our Webinar was hosted by Melissa Baptiste, a New-York based Photographer. We highlighted the importance of archiving and documenting your work. Next season, we want to continue providing concrete, free information to artists on how to develop and grow their portfolios. We will have more guests who share their own personal knowledge on marketing and exhibiting their work.</p><p>Responsibilities</p><ul><li>Podcast guest, host, artist feature, and brand partnership outreach</li></ul><ul><li>Revise and implement podcast structure and storyline</li></ul><ul><li>Collecting and managing guest and audio submissions</li></ul><ul><li>Ensuring the quality of the recording</li></ul><ul><li>Creating promotional campaigns for social media including graphics and video</li></ul><ul><li>Weekly podcast/webinar production including editing, copywriting and publishing</li></ul><ul><li>Copywriting for SM and blog posts</li></ul><p>Requirements</p><ul><li>Passion for non-profit work, social impact, storytelling, and/or uplifting the WOC and non-binary BIPOC communities</li></ul><ul><li>A genuine interest in supporting local artists, journalism, and sharing their stories</li></ul><ul><li>An interest in podcast production, platform growth, or digital marketing</li></ul><ul><li>Excellent organizational, written, and verbal skills</li></ul><ul><li>Excellent written and verbal skills</li></ul><ul><li>Willingness to take the initiative and learn</li></ul><ul><li>Ability to conduct individual research, adapt, and pick up new skills</li></ul><ul><li>Be on time for meetings and recording sessions</li></ul><p>Preferred</p><ul><li>Experience with logistics coordination including but not limited to scheduling appointments, following up with guests and features</li></ul><ul><li>Experience with podcast production, editing software such as Soundtrap</li></ul><ul><li>Experience using InDesign or Canva</li></ul><ul><li>Experience with video editing using phone apps such as iMovie, InShot, or Spark</li></ul><ul><li>Experience with copywriting</li></ul><p>Work Hours &amp; Benefits</p><ul><li>10-15 hours per week with a 1-2 hour weekly team meeting</li></ul><ul><li>School credit, if currently enrolled</li></ul><ul><li>Recommendation letter upon request</li></ul><ul><li>Build your portfolio with tangible projects</li></ul><ul><li>Build relationships with artists and industry peers</li></ul><p>This is an unpaid internship.
