We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.\n<br><br>\nThe Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.\n<br><br>\nEnhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments\n<br><br>\nCurrent and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.\n<br><br>\nBig Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system\n<br><br>\nFermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task.

Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.\n<br><br>\nThe human immune system is an astonishing diagnostic system, continuously adapting itself to detect any signal of disease in the body. Essentially, the state of the immune system tells a story about virtually everything affecting a person’s health. It may sound like science fiction, but what if we could “read” this story? Our scientific understanding of human health would be fundamentally advanced. And more importantly, this would provide a foundation for a new generation of precise medical diagnostic and treatment options.\n<br><br>\nMicrosoft Health Futures is partnering with Adaptive Biotechnologies to develop the machine learning and biotechnology tools that will allow us to realize this dream. Our mission: To create a universal blood test that reads a person’s immune system to detect a wide variety of diseases including infections, cancers and autoimmune disorders in their earliest stages, when they can be most effectively diagnosed and treated. Together, we are building an interdisciplinary team of machine learning experts, software engineers, computational biologists, and immunologists who will make this dream a reality.

The physical world is increasingly incorporating computing technology as the cost of computing power drops and networking of devices increases. Reliability and security are becoming even more important in this environment.\n<br><br>\nThe Checked C project is investigating how to improve the C programming language. C and C++ are the languages of choice for system programming, Checked C is an extension to C that adds checking to detect or prevent common programming errors in C. Checked C provides an incremental path for making existing systems software more reliable and secure, while maintaining the large investments and the knowledge embodied in today’s software. More information on Checked C can be found at https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc\n<br><br>\nYou will help implement the Checked C language extension in the Checked C compiler based on clang/LLVM. A novel aspect of the Checked C extension is that it incorporates extensive static checking into the language definition. You will help implement static checking for Checked C and may also prototype or implement language features for static checking. You may also work on other aspects of the Checked C compiler implementation\n<br><br>\nResponsibilities\n<br><br>\nInterns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world’s best researchers, interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, students are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.\n<br><br>\nAdditional Responsibilities\n<br><br>\nYou will be expected to write a report about your work and make a presentation on your work\n<br><br>\nQualifications\n<br><br>\nIn addition to the qualifications below, you’ll need to submit a minimum of two reference letters for this position.

Each team will receive the appropriate resources, including mentors, to accomplish their goal and complete assignments. Our interns are sharp, and can think both strategically and creatively no matter what discipline they're assigned to.\n<br><br>\nThe Marketing Sciences department quantitatively assesses the strategic opportunity and defines the analytical/measurement requirements of the solution (e.g., segments, treatment groups, business rules, KPIs).
