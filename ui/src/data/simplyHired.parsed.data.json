We’re known for providing marketing, printing, websites and strategic guidance to thousands of brands, businesses and nonprofits. Our clients and partners count on us as a force in our areas of expertise to help them do more good.\n<br><br>\nSee if this position sounds like your dream job. We can’t wait to find out if it could be you.\n<br><br>\nJob Description\n<br><br>\nHow do you know if you're a perfect fit for our technology team? You simply love technology and you are phenomenal at helping others with their problems. You get giddy at the thought of tearing apart a computer to figure out why it won’t boot. You love it when your friends and family members ask you to help them with their computer problems. In fact, you’d probably be a little hurt if they didn’t.\n<br><br>\nAs a member of Firespring’s IT Team, you’ll be in great hands, being mentored by individuals who view technology and innovation as their passions. You will work closely with all departments across the company finding innovative ways for our employees to solve their technological problems and work more efficiently. At Firespring, IT is about more than installing software and fixing error messages. We love to find new and creative ways to solve our company’s technical challenges and we promise that every day will present you with a new puzzle.\n<br><br>\nStill interested? Read on.\n<br><br>\nQualifications\n<br><br>\nWe’re looking for candidates with experience in some or all of the following disciplines:\n<br><br>\n<b>Networking:</b> Firewall configuration/concepts, VLANs, Trunking 802.1 q, etc\n<br><br>\n<b>SaaS software and Cloud IT deployment and support:</b><br>\nG Suite, o365, Slack, Salesforce, SAML integration, etc.\n<br><b>Microsoft:</b> Active Directory/Group Policy, CIFS, MSSQL system administration\n<br><b>Scripting:</b> Powershell, Bash, VBScript, Python\n<br><br>\nTasks and Responsibilities\n<br><br>\nAs the newest member of Firespring’s IT team, you will work closely with our finance team and across all departments to design, architect, build and support a system for automating expense management in our company. You will be responsible for researching different solutions, putting together a business case for management which includes an explanation of ROI, budget, supportability, business continuity, and scalability. You will also be responsible for working across all departments in the company to roll out the approved solution to have a major, long-term effect on Firespring’s productivity and profitability. Additional responsibilities will be helping Firespring Team members with generalized computer assistance and troubleshooting, assisting our Help Desk and identifying ways that Firespring can improve its internal technology systems.\n<br><br>\n<b>Preferred Qualifications:</b><br>\nPursuing a Bachelor’s or Associate’s Degree in Computer Science or Engineering, Information Systems, or a related field.\n<br>Two or more semesters of related technology coursework.\n<br>Strong oral and written communication skills.\n<br><br>\nCompensation and Benefits\n<br><br>\nSalary—Hourly, we like to take care of our interns and your parents will like that you don’t need to hit them up…as much.\n<br>Hours—20-40 hours/week, flexible\n<br>Fun—Millions of people go to work, punch the clock from 8 to 5 and hate every moment of it—that’s not the case here. We have an indoor slide, a game room that includes shuffleboard, a pool table, a foosball table, a Ping Pong table and more. To put it mildly, we’re serious about having fun.\n<br>Miscellaneous Benefits—Not all benefits are about the Benjamins, baby. Some of the things you’ll enjoy while working here include unlimited soda, tea and beer (of course only if of age). And don’t worry about your duds—casual is the dress code here. Still looking to make your cubicle-shackled intern friends jealous of your new gig? Our company-wide social and recreational activities are sure to do just that.\n<br><br>\nReady to come aboard?\n<br><br>\nPlease include a cover letter. Resumes without one won't be considered. Seriously.\n<br><br>\nWhile we genuinely appreciate your interest in employment with Firespring, we can only respond to the most qualified candidates.\n<br><br>\nFirespring is an EEO/AA employer.</div><div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"h3\">Full Job Description</div><div class=\"p\">About Rippling\n<br><br>\nRippling is the first way for businesses to manage their HR &amp; IT — from payroll and benefits, to employee computers and apps — all in one, modern system.\n<br><br>\nIn just 90-seconds, a company can set up (or disable) an employee's payroll, health insurance, work computer, and third-party apps, like Gmail, Microsoft Office, and Slack. It's the only platform that truly unifies every employee system, and automates all of the administrative work.\n<br><br>\nRippling is headquartered in San Francisco and has raised over $200M from top-tier investors, including Founders Fund, Greenoaks Capital, Coatue Management, Kleiner Perkins, and YCombinator. About The Role\n<br><br>\nWe are looking for highly motivated students to join our team for internships beginning in September 2021. As an intern, you will work on a real project (or a few) and have an opportunity to enjoy our fast paced and innovative environment. You will get the opportunity to build products and features that fulfill our mission; free smart people to work on hard problems.\n<br>About Our Teams\n<br>Insurance Team\n<br><br>\nThe insurance team builds the product that manages all aspects of the insurance benefits that a company provides to its employees. It covers medical, dental, vision. long terms disability, short term disability, life, FSA, HSA, Cobra, Commuter, and ACA , etc. It has an admin portal and employee facing app. It is an important piece of the product line in Rippling's offering. We are also a platform where other broker channels can use our platform to manage benefits for their corporate clients.\n<br>Device Team\n<br><br>\nThe Device Management product enables IT admins to secure and manage company devices and data effortlessly. When a customer hires a new employee, Rippling ships them a laptop that is preconfigured with the new employee's user account, all of the company's security settings, and any software the new employee needs. This makes onboarding easy for new hires, and saves hours of an IT admin's time. Our device management team is building out an entire product vertical that competes against multi-billion dollar incumbents like Jamf -- and by building our device management product on top of an employee system of record, we're able to build better automation and outcompete those standalone device management products.\n<br><br>\nThe tech stack on the device management team is broader than most other teams within Rippling. In addition to full-stack web development in Python and Javascript, the device team also runs Chef and Ruby on managed devices, with a lot of Bash and Powershell to interact with the OS, and infrastructure to manage clusters of devices across Linux, Mac, and Windows.\n<br>Identity Team\n<br><br>\nOur Identity product automates the management of employee accounts in 400+ cloud services. When one of our customers hires an employee, our system automatically creates the employee's accounts in G Suite, Slack, Dropbox, GitHub, AWS, etc, adds the user to the right groups and permissions, and allows the employee to sign in to those services using SAML or RPass -- Rippling's end-to-end encrypted password manager. We work closely with our integration partners and our business development team to build new integrations, manage our existing partnerships, and most importantly, build an integration ecosystem that is a key long term moat for Rippling's business.\n<br>HRIS Team\n<br><br>\nThe Human Resource Information Systems ( HRIS) team is responsible for building products for employee lifecycle management, employee experience management, compliance management, documents management and talent management. Each product as a stand-alone is part of a multi-billion dollar market.\n<br>Engineers working on this team will get to develop products that are used by Rippling customers and internal engineering teams, they will work on scaling the existing products, help in reducing latency and in making the products more secure.\n<br>Platform Team\n<br><br>\nThe platform team builds both the product and technology foundations of Rippling. We're responsible for the core service framework, permissioning, and any other core technologies needed to write backend code at Rippling.\n<br><br>\nWe're also responsible for core product platforms like data reporting products, workflows, search, and RQL (Rippling Query Language), which are both external and internal facing. Projects like our workflow product allows company admins to define bespoke action and triggers to customize their Rippling ecosystem.\n<br><br>\n<b>What You'll Do:</b><br>\nDevelop high quality software with attention to detail\n<br><br>\nDesign, develop, code, and test software systems, improvements, products and user-facing experiences\n<br><br>\nWork alongside software architects and senior developers doing state-of-the-art development work\n<br><br>\nContribute to product design and implementation discussions\n<br><br>\nFind and build unique solutions to implement projects from the idea phase to production\n<br><br>\nConnect with intern peers, new teammates, and colleagues from across the business\n<br><br>\nBecome the in-house expert on Rippling customers and competition\n<br><br>\n<b>Qualifications:</b><br>\nCurrently enrolled in Bachelors, Masters, or PhD program in Computer Science, or related field\n<br><br>\nYou will be graduating May 2022 or later\n<br><br>\nKnowledge of algorithms, data structures, and systems architecture\n<br><br>\nYou care about product ownership and solving problems for our customers\n<br><br>\nYou're passionate about being in a product focused environment where everyone cares deeply about customer impact\n<br><br>\n#li-remote\n<br>Even if you don't meet all of the requirements listed here, we still encourage you to apply. Skills can be used in lots of different ways and your life and professional experience may be relevant beyond what a list of requirements will capture.\n<br><br>\nRippling is an equal opportunity employer.</div><div></div>",
