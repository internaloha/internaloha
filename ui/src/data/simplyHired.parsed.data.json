Join the Software Team Summer 2022 Internship program at Ginkgo Bioworks and become a part of the next great technological revolution - constructing, editing, and redesigning the living world in order to answer the globe’s growing challenges in health, energy, food, materials, and more. This is your chance to not only develop algorithms and frameworks at the cutting edge of software technologies, but also work side-by-side with the brightest scientists, organism engineers, and more. You'll have the opportunity to contribute to the exciting frontiers of synthetic biology, including DNA design, genome sequencing, and automating experiments at scales previously unheard of.\n<br><br>\nAt Ginkgo, our mission is to make biology easier to engineer. Our bioengineers make use of an in-house automated foundry for designing and building new organisms. Today, our foundry is developing over 40 different organisms to make different products across multiple industries.

Netflix is reinventing entertainment from end to end. We are revolutionizing how shows and movies are produced, pushing technological boundaries to efficiently deliver streaming video at massive scale over the internet, and continuously improving and personalizing how content is presented around the globe.\n<br><br>\nAs Netflix produces more content and we expand our global presence, it becomes even more\n<br>important to get people excited about stories that are right for them. Promoting our titles\n<br>happens on our consumer-facing product, and through external marketing and publicity\n<br>channels. To help consumers find the stories they’ll love, we need to create a diverse set of\n<br>promotional media assets for many different tastes, and to get these materials in front of the\n<br>right people.\n<br><br>\nThe Marketing Planning &amp; Distribution Engineering team creates technology that enables the efficient planning and distribution of promotional campaigns across Netflix marketing channels. Our platforms drive operational excellence for stakeholder decision-making related to campaign support, campaign launches, and global, cross-functional team coordination.

We match qualified interns with projects and groups based on interests and skill sets, and fully embed interns within those groups for the summer. Netflix is a unique place to work and we live by our values, so it's worth learning more about our culture.\n<br><br>\nInternships are paid and are a minimum of 12 weeks, with a choice of a few fixed start dates in May or June to accommodate varying school calendars. Conditions permitting, our 2022 summer internships will be located either remotely, in our Los Gatos, CA office, or in our Los Angeles, CA office, depending on the team.\n<br><br>\nNetflix is an equal opportunity employer that celebrates diversity, recognizing that diversity of thought and background builds stronger teams.

Across our core initiatives of Science and Education, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and advocacy, to progress in our mission of building an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.\n<br><br>\nOur Values\n<br><br>\nWe believe we can help build a future for everyone.\n<br><br>\n<b>We aim to be daring, but humble:</b> We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.\n<br><b>We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term:</b> We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.\n<br><b>Stay close to the real problems:</b> We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.\n<br><br>\nOur success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.\n<br><br>\nThe Opportunity\n<br><br>\nOur work in education is aimed at ensuring that every student — not just a lucky few — can get an education that's tailored to their individual needs and supports every aspect of their development. We're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy, and advocacy work to help every young person enter adulthood with the skills and abilities they need to reach their full potential — and equip every teacher with the tools and research they need to help students get there. An example of the work CZI's education team supports include the Summit Learning Program, a personalized approach to teaching and learning that enhances the quality of student-teacher interactions and empowers educators to tailor instruction to individual student needs.\n<br><br>\nOur Education Data Science team is responsible for measuring and evaluating product and program changes. For example, how product impacts student performance on cognitive skills, how schools onboard onto the program or how professional development impacts on onboarding, etc. This team defines measurements, product metrics, provides product insights through analysis, recommends what to improve and build next, as well as collaborates and communicates with the cross-functional and leadership teams.\n<br><br>\nYou will\n<br>Influence decisions on our product development and education program. You will do this via data analysis in SQL and Python/R, and through presentations.\n<br><b>Develop expertise on our users:</b> students, teachers, and school leaders.\n<br>Collaborate in a cross-functional team, which includes product management, engineering, design, and user research.\n<br>Define success for your team in collaboration with product managers and your mentor. You will evaluate and measure the success of new product features.\n<br>You have\n<br>Experience in solving analytical problems using quantitative approaches (or equivalent)\n<br>Experience with SQL and other programming languages (R or Python)\n<br>Experience solving data-driven problems, including problem definition, data exploration, solution proposal, implementation, testing, and evaluation\n<br>Excellent communication and organizational skills\n<br>Currently working on the process of obtaining, a Bachelors, Masters, or PhD degree in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, or a related data-oriented technical field and will have time remaining in school after your summer internship\n<br>The ability to work for 12 consecutive weeks during Summer 2022\n<br>Targeted graduation date between December 2022 through Summer 2023\n<br>Nice to have\n<br>Curious, self-driven, analytical and excited to play with real-world data\n<br>Data Science experience from previous internships, work experience, academic research, lab work, or personal projects\n<br>Passion for social impact or education policy.\n<br><br>\nCZI believes that vaccines are one of the most powerful tools to fight COVID-19 and save lives. It aligns to our mission and work to cure, manage, and prevent disease. Proof of completed COVID-19 vaccination will be required for all applicants and employees to come onsite to a CZI facility.
