# Scrapers V2

## Overview

Scrapers V2 reimplements the initial version of InternAloha's scrapers with:

  * Typescript rather than Javascript.
  * A Scraper superclass that provides a common structure for implementation of a scraper. This design is documented in [https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad2/issues/726](https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad2/issues/726).
  * Sequential rather than parallel execution.
  * Use of [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) for top-level CLI processing.
