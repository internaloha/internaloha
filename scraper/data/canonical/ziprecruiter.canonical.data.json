AWS tools used will include CloudWatch, Inspector, Systems Manager, GuardDuty, Kibana, and QuickSight, with opportunities for the addition of custom tools for configuration management, training, and other elements to complete a robust Cloud-based security framework for KBR. The framework will include an end-to-end DevSecOps platform designed to automate security requirements by embedding security controls and processes early in the DevOps workflow, and will help our customers continue to develop and apply new technology capabilities while retaining systems security. </p><p> Additional projects will include investigating the value of Digital Twin (DT) in autonomous systems use cases; investigate setting up for the use cases and how the operational AI systems would interact with DT requirements. Explore methodology to address operational decision making utilizing machine learning in Air Traffic Management and other domains. Analyze textual information in transportation datasets to identify commonalities; demonstrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) capability. </p><p>Managing telematics data, implement ability to overlay multiple vehicle routes on a map to assess road utilization. Other projects will be similar to last year's summer internship program which consisted of: Reinforcement learning technique to enable autonomous systems and robotics. Research Explainable AI and leveraging this technology to detect bias in machine learning models. </p><p>Use distributed ledger/block-chain technology to enable governance and management of flight identifiers. Edge computing utilizing neuromorphic processing. Research and development of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) software and hardware tools; develop an AR/VR solution to simulate real-world environments and facilitate activities such as remote maintenance of complex systems and virtual training environments. </p><p> Interns will spend the majority of their time researching, installing, and configuring new tools, programming using the selected tools, and learning more efficient methods to solve a given problem. Interns are not required to be programming experts, but they should have a passion for learning new things and not be afraid to jump in and try out new tools and/or solutions. Interns will leverage an Agile Development process with daily scrum meetings facilitated using Jira to capture user stories and track the status of all issues. </p><p>Fridays are reserved for documenting the work each week in the form of a Wiki site, as well as numerous forms of documentation (PowerPoint, Word, Visio, etc.). Once a month, interns will present the work they have completed to other staff members at KBR, with a final presentation at the end of the summer to both KBR and customer personnel. **Required Education:** + Must be enrolled in undergraduate coursework in a related degree program at an accredited university + Must be a Rising Junior or Senior **Preferred:** + Basic familiarity with virtual environments and cloud-based technologies, as well as programming languages such as Java, Python, Perl etc. </p><p> Work Schedule: Estimated at 32-40 hours/week with flexibility to accommodate intern's education Work Location: Telework **Scheduled Weekly Hours:** 40 KBR is an equal opportunity employer.
