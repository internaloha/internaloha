As the hospitals and clinics are still modernizing, there are many challenges faced and as a result you will also see medical conditions that have remained untreated and have developed to an advanced pathological stage.

You will experience the stark contrast between western medical practice and the realities of medicine in developing countries. As the hospitals and clinics are still modernizing there are many challenges faced and there are realities not often seen in developed countries. Therefore, this project not only provides you with responsibility, it also allows you to broaden your perspective by working at a hospital/health clinic in a developing country where you will be faced with the stark realities of the disparities between medical practice in the developed and developing world. This means that, sadly, you will also see medical conditions that have remained untreated and have developed to an advanced pathological stage uncommon in developed countries.

The classes focus on developing communication skills so that students are able to put their knowledge to practical use as soon as they step outside the classroom. Our teaching method enables students to develop four basic skills: listening comprehension, speaking, reading and writing. The idea is to learn Spanish in a natural and spontaneous way, just as students have learned their mother tongue. Our students are encouraged to speak Spanish right from the very first day, using it in typical real-life situations: the basic syllabus is supplemented by special exercises, such as role-play, situational dialogues and work projects. Outside the classroom, the learning process continues as you are immersed in the Spanish language and the Dominican culture.</p><p><strong>Contact Information&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Contact Person: Manfred Mönnighoff</p><p>Project/charity name: Fundación Aldeas de Paz</p><p>Address: Samana, Dominican Republic</p><p>Whatsapp: +1 829 7055 123</p><p>E-Mail: <a href=\"mailto:mail@peacevillages.org\">mail@peacevillages.org</a></p><p>Webpage: <a href=\"https://www.peacevillages.org?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.peacevillages.org</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook/AldeasdePaz?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook/AldeasdePaz</a></p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/AldeasDePaz?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/AldeasDePaz</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AldeasDePaz?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/AldeasDePaz</a></p><p>YouTube: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/Peacevillages?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/Peacevillages</a></p>"
