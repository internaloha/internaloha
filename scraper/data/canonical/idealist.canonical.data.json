This first summer on the farm will expose the intern to daily farm work and give them an idea of different farming methods.&nbsp; Interns will also take park in infrastructure upkeep and animal husbandry including rotating chicken and sheep, mucking chicken coops, fixing fencing and irrigation, digging trenches, and pulling thistle.</p><p><br></p><p>The second stage of the internship will involve planning and implementing their own incubator farm.&nbsp; During the fall or winter the intern will work to create a farm business plan and seeding and planting plan with the Production Manager of The Farm Collaborative.&nbsp; This will include documenting the calculations on what to plant, projected farm harvests and sales, seed purchases and orders based on projected plantings, and research on market opportunities.&nbsp; The intern will be able to do these projects in conjunction with the Production Manager and will have access to the Farm Collaborative’s harvest and sales data from previous years as a baseline.&nbsp; This second year the intern will not receive a stipend for time spent on their personal test plot, but they will have the option to work part time for the farm collaborative to supplement their pilot year.</p><p><br></p><p>If the intern chooses, they will then be able to take and implement this farm plan during the subsequent summer.&nbsp; The Farm Collaborative will provide allocated space for this farmer as a test plot, space at the Aspen Farmers’ Market booth, and access to wholesale or CSA connections forged by the Farm Collaborative.&nbsp; They will be able to utilize the farm equipment provided by the Farm Collaborative, including small greenhouse structures, seeding materials, and machinery.&nbsp; This final project collaboration will culminate in a comparison of the planting, harvesting, and business plan projections to the actual harvests and sales achieved during that year.&nbsp; It will give the new farmer a taste of what a real farm year would be like without having to make the big investments.&nbsp; </p>"

From the semi-independent bureaus of the Treasury Department (the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the IRS) to the Federal Reserve, OMB, FTC, and beyond, executive branch personnel play a significant role in determining the fundamental rules that govern our economy.</p><p>The Revolving Door Project educates civil society in order to counteract the advantage that Wall Street and corporate America have in this rule writing process. We do this by alerting and educating the media and activists when hardworking people are being taken advantage of and clarifying by whom. If we want the executive branch to write rules that structure the economy away from rent extraction and in the direction of greater economic equality, we need to ensure the right people hold key executive branch positions like the Treasury Secretary and SEC Commissioner. The executive branch needs to empower dedicated civil servants rather than self-interested people rotating between relatively short stints in government and longer stints in the very industries they’re supposed to regulate.</p><p><br></p><p><em>CEPR provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, creed, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital or veteran status, or sexual expression and identity.

We partner with government leaders, frontline staff, think tanks, service providers, and foundations to generate insight and drive system reform. We are nationally recognized for our child welfare expertise and for producing innovative research to drive decision-making.</p><p><br></p><p>What we do</p><p>We work on a range of policy topics within child welfare including foster home recruitment, kinship placements, permanency, and prevention services, among other areas. We tailor each project to the needs of our partner and produce accessible results that program staff and funders can use to make concrete decisions.</p><p>Our work takes multiple forms:&nbsp;</p><p>•\tWe conduct operational and exploratory research to understand how child welfare policies, practices, and systems are functioning, translate findings into strategic recommendations, and then help our partners leverage these recommendations to improve outcomes for children and families.&nbsp;</p><p>•\tWe evaluate program models and interventions to learn what is working – and what work remains to be done. We seek to understand the context, history, strengths, and challenges of particular approaches, complementing statistical quantitative techniques with focus groups, interviews, and on-the-ground work to assess program operations.</p><p>•\tWe help develop and launch strategies to analyze system outcomes and performance. We design and support systems that utilize administrative data to allow leadership and staff to monitor progress, strengthen services, and improve outcomes.</p><p>In addition to rigorous designs and multiple research methods, we tap into sources of knowledge that are often overlooked. We have developed expertise in analyzing administrative data, an under-utilized resource that often produces findings unobtainable elsewhere. We pair the results of data analysis with the perspectives of clients, front line workers, middle managers, executives, and external stakeholders to form a comprehensive picture of how policies and programs are experienced.&nbsp;</p><p>We are committed to creating strong relationships with our partners. We invest in building trust with stakeholders, seek to minimize the burden of research on operations, and communicate actionable insights as they develop.

The survey asked general questions on business type, workforce size, location, and space, as well as questions about the future of the business and their needs in the neighborhood. A survey of businesses at this scale in LIC had never been done before and served to both provide information and legitimize the existing mix of LIC businesses. In 2017, LICP conducted an update to the initial survey sending out the same questions via online form, with outreach focused on email and existing contact lists.</p><p>It has now been five years since the first survey, and with the 2020 Census wrapping up, the unforeseen economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, and major changes ahead with transitions in the next year at all levels of government, it is vital that we have updated information to share. The survey will enable us to validate the unique mix of businesses and organizations in LIC, educate our community and government on their needs, and ultimately inform decision-making affecting LIC, including as plans are made for economic recovery.</p><p><strong>As part of this effort the Partnership is seeking one or two interns to conduct phone and email outreach and follow-up to local businesses, administer surveys, and collect, clean-up, and analyze data to help inform policy discussions.</strong></p><p><strong>Time Commitment</strong>: minimum 3-4 weeks; beginning January 2021. 10 – 15 hours per week remote work, during regular business hours, Monday through Friday.</p><p><strong>Hourly Pay:</strong> $15.00</p><p><em>Intern Responsibilities: </em></p><p>•&nbsp;Conducting surveys with business owners via phone and following up on survey respondents with missing or incorrect information</p><p>•&nbsp;Providing feedback to help us refine our outreach strategy based on outreach</p><p>•&nbsp;Reviewing for completion, cleaning-up, tallying, and tabulating survey responses</p><p>•&nbsp;Projecting and maintaining a respectful, professional comportment while interacting with businesses</p><p><em>Qualifications:</em></p><p>•&nbsp;Excellent interpersonal and communication skills</p><p>•&nbsp;Self-motivated and comfortable asking questions while working remotely</p><p>•&nbsp;Prior experience with canvasing, community outreach, survey distribution, and/or data collection</p><p>• Interest in Western Queens, urban planning, economic or community development, small businesses, data collection, survey methods, and/or community outreach</p><p>•&nbsp;Excellent data entry skills (attention to detail); data analysis skills are a plus</p><p>•&nbsp;Available weekdays during morning and afternoon/evening hours</p><p>•&nbsp;Language skills in Spanish, Mandarin, or Korean highly valued</p><p>•&nbsp;Currently enrolled in undergraduate or graduate coursework or equivalent work experience</p><p><strong>Please send resume and cover letter to Madeleine Levin, </strong><a href=\"mailto:mlevin@licpartnership.org\">mlevin@licpartnership.org</a>.

Atlas Aegis LLC</a>, we won an injunction against a private mercenary company that had threatened to send ex-special forces operatives to Minnesota’s polling places.

We’ll continue to hold President Trump legally accountable even after he leaves office. And, we will remain vigilant in challenging corruption at all levels of our government.</p><p><strong>Fighting big money in politics and corporate abuse of power.</strong> We’ve helped develop and pass cutting-edge campaign finance legislation in <a href=\"http://freespeechforpeople.org/seattle-legislation?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">Seattle</a> and <a href=\"https://freespeechforpeople.org/st-petersburg-campaign?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">St. Petersburg, Florida</a> that will end super PACs in city elections and ban political spending by corporations partly owned by foreign investors, and we’ve helped <a href=\"https://freespeechforpeople.org/challenging-claims-of-corporate-constitutional-rights?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">defend</a> public interest laws against corporate challenges.

HLA also engages in system-wide litigation, public policy advocacy, and educational programming to advance its goals. For more information visit <a href=\"https://www.healthlawadvocates.org?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.healthlawadvocates.org/</a><u>.</u></p><p>HLA is committed to diversity in its workforce.

We also defend our clients against illegal medical billing and debt collection practices.</p><p>Our General Legal Practice also protects certain populations facing systemic barriers to health care.

The classes focus on developing communication skills so that students are able to put their knowledge to practical use as soon as they step outside the classroom. Our teaching method enables students to develop four basic skills: listening comprehension, speaking, reading and writing. The idea is to learn Spanish in a natural and spontaneous way, just as students have learned their mother tongue. Our students are encouraged to speak Spanish right from the very first day, using it in typical real-life situations: the basic syllabus is supplemented by special exercises, such as role-play, situational dialogues and work projects. Outside the classroom, the learning process continues as you are immersed in the Spanish language and the Dominican culture.</p><p><strong>Contact Information&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Contact Person: Manfred Mönnighoff</p><p>Project/charity name: Fundación Aldeas de Paz</p><p>Address: Samana, Dominican Republic</p><p>Whatsapp: +1 829 7055 123</p><p>E-Mail: <a href=\"mailto:mail@peacevillages.org\">mail@peacevillages.org</a></p><p>Webpage: <a href=\"https://www.peacevillages.org?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.peacevillages.org</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook/AldeasdePaz?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook/AldeasdePaz</a></p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/AldeasDePaz?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/AldeasDePaz</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AldeasDePaz?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/AldeasDePaz</a></p><p>YouTube: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/Peacevillages?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/Peacevillages</a></p>"

The name of this area is the Ñeembucú Wetland Complex. Located in Southwestern Paraguay, this area has been heavily understudied. Home to squirmy eels, tiny minnows, hundreds of cichlids, and giant stingrays, this mosaic habitat is certainly hiding new species for science.</p><p>Para La Tierra is searching for talented and hardworking research interns to join our team in Paraguay for 3 to 6 months. Our internship program provides young biologists an opportunity to step out of the classroom and into the field, gaining hands-on experience running a research project of their own design. Before arriving, our interns are challenged to come up with a research topic, review the relevant literature, and create a methodology with the support of our intern-supervisor. Towards the end of the stay, all our interns give a final presentation in which they share the results of their study with the rest of the research team.

Our internship program provides young biologists an opportunity to step out of the classroom and into the field, gaining hands-on experience running a research project of their own design. Based in the center of the Ñeembucú Wetland System, Para La Tierra’s research team has been investigating the behavior, ecology, and social structure of the Black-&amp;-Gold Howler monkey. Our research station offers an incredible opportunity to study these highly adaptable arboreal primates in a variety of different habitats, from riparian forests to the city parks. As tropical forests continue to disappear, it is increasingly important to understand how wild animals can survive alongside human populations. Para La Tierra is interested in understanding how the primates are affected by the urban environment of the city of Pilar, how their behavior varies from that of the groups located outside the city, and what can be done to better protect the wild animals from the negative effects of the near constant human-wildlife interaction.</p><p><br></p><p>Primate Behaviour Research Interns are challenged to further our collective understanding of the Howler monkeys found in Ñeembucú. With the help of our expert on-site primatologist, each intern creates their own methodology, collects independent data, analyses their results, and presents their findings.
