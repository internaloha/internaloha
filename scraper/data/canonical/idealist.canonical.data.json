As one of the world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in more than 100 countries, connecting cutting-edge conservation science with the collective power of our partners in the field – more than one million supporters in the United States and five million globally, as well as partnerships with communities, companies, and governments.</p><p><br></p><p>Our vision for diversity, equity and inclusion at WWF is an organization as diverse as the world we protect; where the richness of all our unique views, experiences, and backgrounds combines to create the most sustainable and inclusive conservation outcomes possible — bringing the greatest benefit to the planet and every person who lives on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Across the many cultures and individuals that represent WWF, we are unified by one mission, one brand, and one common set of values: Courage, Respect, Integrity and Collaboration.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Internships at WWF</u></strong></p><p>WWF's internship program vision is to recruit professionals early in their careers who bring fresh thinking and innovation to the environmental and conservation sector and are well positioned to develop into the next generation of leaders. Our mission is to increase exposure of students from underrepresented populations to conservation and environmental careers, provide professional development opportunities, reduce the barriers to attracting a diverse pool of internship candidates, and develop a pipeline for future WWF hires from underrepresented populations.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Position Overview</strong></p><p>World Wildlife Fund (WWF), one of the world's leading conservation organizations, seeks a Human Resources Intern with the Human Resources Team.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Position Summary</u></strong></p><p>The Job Description is one of the most important Personnel Documents for an employee. The Job Description is a roadmap of core responsibilities and duties that also articulates the competencies necessary to perform successfully in one's role. Over the years, WWF has had multiple repositories and formats for the all-important Job Description, and to date, final versions have been inconsistently filed, filed in different locations, gone missing entirely, etc. As a result:</p><ul><li>Finding the most recent job description for any given role or individual employee is difficult and time consuming.</li><li>Some job descriptions are not available or need to be written from memory/scratch.</li><li>HR Business Partners (HRBPs) cannot easily access an specific employee's job description at any given time, because job descriptions are organized not by individuals name, but by job title.</li><li>Multiple job descriptions may exist for one job title (and job titles have also historically been inconsistently applied), so it is difficult to say which description corresponds to each employee.</li></ul><p>This internship will play a pivotal role in leading the charge on “WWF's Job Description Repository Project”. The successful culmination of this project will result in a cohesive and up-to-date WWF Jobs Repository where each employee (~600 total) has an updated job description at all times. The repository must be intuitive to navigate and easy to access for HR Business Partners and other HR colleagues. This is an opportunity to provide great value to what has been a pain-point for WWF employees and HR alike for many years.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li>Work closely with the HR Business Partners team to learn the various historical repositories and processes for housing Job Descriptions</li><li>Become oriented to all HR systems and filing structures</li><li>Create a detailed tracker for each division (corresponding to each HR Business Partner) and up-to-date job title, level, family, etc. and maintain a record of when each employee's current job description has been saved within the tracker.</li><li>Match each WWF employee with existing job descriptions and put in the repository.</li><li>Create a report of employee status: updated, dated, or missing job description.</li><li>Organize and implement a process for maintaining and updating employee job descriptions so all employees have an up-to-date job description in their file at all times.</li><li>Present a final report and close the project.</li><li>Other duties as assigned.</li></ul><p><strong>Internship Description</strong></p><p>Working in close coordination with the HRBP team and WWF Departments' leaders, managers and staff, the HR Intern will lead the execution of the WWF's Job Description Repository Project.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></p><p>You will learn how to get a project done, start to finish, and resolve any obstacles that come your way in the process. Reverse engineer and manage your time starting from the project's outcome; you will learn to monitor and course correct to ensure successful completion. You will develop the leadership skills necessary to entice people at all levels of WWF to support and contribute your work. Your manager will provide you with support and constant feedback to make your internship a success by developing planning, project management and leadership skills.</p><p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>We will be focused on the skills and abilities in this selection process.</li><li>Experience managing a similar project, organizing electronic data, repositories is a plus, but not required.</li><li>We believe this will be an interesting opportunity for somebody interested in Human Resources or more specifically in HR Operations or the HR Business Partner role.

The classes focus on developing communication skills so that students are able to put their knowledge to practical use as soon as they step outside the classroom. Our teaching method enables students to develop four basic skills: listening comprehension, speaking, reading and writing. The idea is to learn Spanish in a natural and spontaneous way, just as students have learned their mother tongue. Our students are encouraged to speak Spanish right from the very first day, using it in typical real-life situations: the basic syllabus is supplemented by special exercises, such as role-play, situational dialogues and work projects. Outside the classroom, the learning process continues as you are immersed in the Spanish language and the Dominican culture.</p><p><strong>Contact Information&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Contact Person: Manfred Mönnighoff</p><p>Project/charity name: Fundación Aldeas de Paz</p><p>Address: Samana, Dominican Republic</p><p>Whatsapp: +1 829 7055 123</p><p>E-Mail: <a href=\"mailto:mail@peacevillages.org\">mail@peacevillages.org</a></p><p>Webpage: <a href=\"https://www.peacevillages.org?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.peacevillages.org</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook/AldeasdePaz?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook/AldeasdePaz</a></p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/AldeasDePaz?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/AldeasDePaz</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AldeasDePaz?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/AldeasDePaz</a></p><p>YouTube: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/Peacevillages?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/Peacevillages</a></p>"
