We design products that transform the way hospitals use data to deliver care. We make analyzing data fast, easy, and useful for everyone.

For example, when trying to automate a field asking whether a patient was on a ventilator during their time in the ICU, you will analyze the data in our knowledge graph for potential answers. Then you will write a bot that takes in the various data and determines if the patient is on the ventilator at the same time as their ICU stay. Other bots use Carta's Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to extract medical concepts from unstructured clinical notes.
