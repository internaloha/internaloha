It’s the only platform that truly unifies every employee system, and automates all of the administrative work.<br><br>Rippling is headquartered in San Francisco and has raised over $200M from top-tier investors, including Founders Fund, Greenoaks Capital, Coatue Management, Kleiner Perkins, and YCombinator.<br><br><strong><u>About The Role<br><br></u></strong>We are looking for highly motivated students to join our team for internships beginning in September 2021. As an intern, you will work on a real project (or a few) and have an opportunity to enjoy our fast paced and innovative environment. You will get the opportunity to build products and features that fulfill our mission; free smart people to work on hard problems.<br><br><strong><u>About Our Teams<br><br></u></strong>Insurance Team<br><br>The insurance team builds the product that manages all aspects of the insurance benefits that a company provides to its employees. It covers medical, dental, vision. long terms disability, short term disability, life, FSA, HSA, Cobra, Commuter, and ACA , etc. It has an admin portal and employee facing app. It is an important piece of the product line in Rippling's offering. We are also a platform where other broker channels can use our platform to manage benefits for their corporate clients.<br><br><strong>Device Team<br><br></strong>The Device Management product enables IT admins to secure and manage company devices and data effortlessly. When a customer hires a new employee, Rippling ships them a laptop that is preconfigured with the new employee's user account, all of the company's security settings, and any software the new employee needs. This makes onboarding easy for new hires, and saves hours of an IT admin's time. Our device management team is building out an entire product vertical that competes against multi-billion dollar incumbents like Jamf -- and by building our device management product on top of an employee system of record, we're able to build better automation and outcompete those standalone device management products.<br><br>The tech stack on the device management team is broader than most other teams within Rippling.

When one of our customers hires an employee, our system automatically creates the employee's accounts in G Suite, Slack, Dropbox, GitHub, AWS, etc, adds the user to the right groups and permissions, and allows the employee to sign in to those services using SAML or RPass -- Rippling's end-to-end encrypted password manager. We work closely with our integration partners and our business development team to build new integrations, manage our existing partnerships, and most importantly, build an integration ecosystem that is a key long term moat for Rippling's business.<br><br><strong>HRIS Team<br><br></strong>The <strong>Human Resource Information Systems (</strong>HRIS) team is responsible for building products for employee lifecycle management, employee experience management, compliance management, documents management and talent management. Each product as a stand-alone is part of a multi-billion dollar market.<br>Engineers working on this team will get to develop products that are used by Rippling customers and internal engineering teams, they will work on scaling the existing products, help in reducing latency and in making the products more secure.<br><br><strong>Platform Team<br><br></strong>The platform team builds both the product and technology foundations of Rippling.

Our AI Enabled Technology offers a complete solution (people, process and technology) to support the Healthcare Registry Data Market. We design products that transform the way hospitals use data to deliver care. We make analyzing data fast, easy, and useful for everyone. We give clinicians time back to focus on research and care that improve patient lives by reducing paperwork. Carta Healthcare is a remote organization with headquarters in San Francisco and Portland, Oregon. To learn more about our AI Enabled Solutions and more about our company, please <em>visit www.carta.healthcare<br><br></em>We are looking for a <strong>Data Science Intern </strong>responsible for analyzing trends in our data, then writing small algorithms to auto-populate data from our knowledge graph. For example, when trying to automate a field asking whether a patient was on a ventilator during their time in the ICU, you will analyze the data in our knowledge graph for potential answers. Then you will write a bot that takes in the various data and determines if the patient is on the ventilator at the same time as their ICU stay. Other bots use Carta's Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to extract medical concepts from unstructured clinical notes. In addition to writing these bots, you will work closely with our engineering team to learn about the cutting edge of data engineering in healthcare.<br><br>You love solving complex engineering problems by understanding trends in the data.

        "description": "\n        When you think about your last doctor’s appointment, how much do you actually recall? If you’re like most people, you’ll likely forget over 40% of the conversation. Details fall through the cracks, generic printouts you receive end up in the trash, and important information never makes it to other doctors. Ultimately, you’re left needing to connect the dots in your care. That’s why we started Abridge with a simple thesis: if we can shift agency to consumers, we can help them stay on top of their health. When you use Abridge to record your health conversations, the conversations themselves become your medical record. It’s as easy as that.<br><br>We are looking for research interns to working on exciting NLP challenges using our large annotated proprietary healthcare datasets. You will be able to create/customize your internship research statement and collaborate with our in-house Machine Learning research team. At the end of the internship, you will also have the opportunity to publish your work at top tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, NAACL, and ACL.<br><br>The goal of the internship is to advance the state-of-the-art in one or many of the following research areas:<br><ul><li> Dialog Understanding</li><li> Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling</li><li> Clinical Natural Language Processing</li><li> Information Extraction</li><li> Machine Learning using Ontologies or Knowledge graphs<br></li></ul><strong>Required<br><br></strong>Qualification <br><ul><li> Must be accepted to or currently enrolled in an MS or Ph.D. program in Computer Science or a related field</li><li> Must have at least one NLP machine learning paper submitted or published</li><li> Experience in utilizing theoretical and empirical research to solve problems</li><li> Ability to communicate complex research ideas in a clear, precise, and actionable manner</li><li>Research internships are offered year-round with flexible durations<br></li></ul><strong>Compensation<br></strong><ul><li>$80,000-$100,000 per year</li></ul>Life at Abridge<br><br>At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.<br><br>Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and believe that \"you need to taste good things to have good taste.\"<br><br>Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).\n      "

Anyone with a deep interest or background in content structure, semantics, analytical philosophy, artificial intelligence, knowledge graphs, and the future of customer experience will find the internship valuable.<br><br>As a Content Intelligence Intern, you will work with our practice to craft intelligent content structure for omnichannel marketing and product documentation, and increase the value of semantically rich content. You will participate in internal and client-focused projects surrounding customer experience management and personalization. You’ll define content structure, metadata, content reuse planning, taxonomy, and other content relationships.<br><br>Interns will work with a team of [A]gents and interns across multiple disciplines within [A] to understand the depth and breadth of both client and internal Content Intelligence projects, <strong>while at the same time delivering a series of work products that contribute to their individual portfolios.<br><br></strong><em>This is a remote role that can be done from anywhere in North America.<br><br></em><strong>As you explore your interests, you will be exposed to the following:<br></strong><ul><li>Content modeling</li><li>Content Strategy</li><li>Analyzing content lifecycles</li><li>Structured authoring</li><li>Semantic technologies</li><li>Knowledge graphs</li><li>Structuring content through content models, taxonomies, and metadata definitions</li><li>Developing XML Schemas and DITA specializations</li><li>Planning content transformation and enrichment workflows (those parts of the content lifecycle not directly related to the subject matter authoring itself.)</li><li>Identifying taxonomy requirements through research and analysis of end-user needs, content management system requirements, and any existing content corpus</li><li>Improving client taxonomies, content models, and content workflows</li><li>Improving process efficiency</li><li>Evaluating client processes and content </li><li>Conducting needs analysis</li><li>Developing SOPs<br></li></ul><strong>If you have education or experience in ANY of the following …<br></strong><ul><li>Enrolled to receive a degree in Technical Communication, Library or Information Science, Computer Science, Linguistics, Analytical Philosophy, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, or similar degrees.</li><li>Content Design</li><li>Technical Communication</li><li>Content Management (ECMS, WCMS, CCMS)</li><li>Structured authoring systems (XML or other)</li><li>Taxonomy, thesauri, and ontology standards and best practices</li><li>Content workflow and lifecycles, content models, and technology environments and how these work together.<br></li></ul><strong>… then we would love to speak with you!<br><br></strong><strong>Cultural Fit at [A]<br></strong><ul><li>You love learning, you love teaching.</li><li>You are constantly growing your own knowledge, and helping to grow the knowledge of others.</li><li>You enjoy wearing multiple hats and roles, and titles are not important to you.</li><li>You do top-quality work, manage quality, and make everything you touch better.</li><li>You are comfortable working under strict confidentiality agreements and often behind-the-scenes.</li><li>You are self-organized and manage time and resources well.</li><li>You are able to not only work alone, but also communicate within a team by sending updates, tracking time, and other forms of communication while you work.<br></li></ul><strong>What is [A]?<br><br></strong>[A] is the Content Intelligence Service, and we work with clients to create a Content Intelligence System. The Content Intelligence System is a holistic set of people, processes, and tools that maximize content-ROI by ensuring content is coherent, self-aware, and quantum. By creating a Content Intelligence System, we increase the effectiveness and ROI of the content assets while reducing overall costs. [A] works holistically to build all aspects of a content intelligence system in partnership with clients and agencies. This includes not just the technology architecture and implementation, but enabling companies with the organizational muscles to drive content intelligence.<br><br><strong>What’s Up With the Name?<br><br></strong>Our name is easy. Just say “A.” The [A] brackets represent markup, microdata, content intelligence. The letter “[A]” represents the start, initiation, beginning of change. We are going to help change the world with intelligent content.<br><br><strong>[A] Team Benefits<br><br></strong>Being an [A]gent comes with its benefits. Work from anywhere. Advance your career on the leading-edge of the content and technology sciences. Earn a competitive salary, and for longtime [A]gents, participation in a profit-sharing plan. But many [A]gents find the best part of working as an [A]gent are the other [A]gents you work with and the culture at [A].<br><br>We take care of each other and we honor each other's work and contributions to the team. We work to make ourselves better and our [A] team better. We make efforts to adapt new technologies and methodologies that can help us optimize our time, and we expect you to collaborate on these efforts if you’re an expert on any of those fields. We communicate and reach out to other [A] players. We love learning. We love teaching. We write. We code. We support each other. For the right people, working at [A] feels like coming home.<br><br>If this sounds like you, then write up a cover letter letting [A] know why you want to work at [A], what you do best, and what inspires you. A great cover letter will say much more than the resume (though we'd like to see that too).<br><br>Powered by JazzHR<br><br>CyCkGRPKF3\n      "
