Today the company runs one of the world's largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine's Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World's Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.\n<br><br>\nWe realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!\n<br><br>\nAbout the department\n<br><br>\nCloudflare's Research Team is involved with building the future of Cloudflare by tackling strategic projects that have a large impact on Cloudflare systems and the Internet at large. Our focus is on solving difficult problems in security, performance, and privacy at scale using cryptographic tools. We are launching new investigations in network architectures and protocols, distributed systems, and measurement. This involves systems engineering, open source software development, protocol design, implementation of primitives, with lots of performance evaluation alongside.

We also welcome novel proposals and ideas that can help to inform or build a better Internet (in the form of a max 200 word proposal).\n<br><br>\nResearch Program Areas\n<br><br>\nCloudflare research has four current program areas. We're looking for interns with interest or expertise in one of these areas.\n<br><br>\nNetwork-layer privacy\n<br><br>\nThis program is about reducing or eliminating metadata on the Internet that can be used to learn about user behavior online when viewed by an unauthorized party. This work helps upgrade Internet protocols so that metadata (hostnames - via SNI, IP addresses, or fingerprintable data) can no longer be easily extracted from Internet packets. Example projects: Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), website fingerprinting protection, intelligent and adaptive authoritative DNS, and connection coalescing.\n<br><br>\nApplication-layer privacy\n<br><br>\nThis program is about reducing or eliminating personal data at the application layer: applying innovative techniques based on splitting data between parties to make personal data superfluous or less identifiable so it isn't needed in the delivery of powerful products and services both at Cloudflare and throughout the Internet ecosystem. Example projects: Cryptographic Attestation of Personhood, privacy-preserving analytics, Privacy Pass, and password-authenticated key exchange.\n<br><br>\nMapping the Internet\n<br><br>\nThis program is about measuring and mapping the components that are present on the Internet and how they interact with traffic. Cloudflare is among the most connected networks on the Internet and has visibility down to the client in many circumstances (Warp, Browser extensions). Work in this program measures the network to understand how it is evolving with an eye on helping improve availability, security, and performance. Example projects: BGP hijack detection and mitigation, traffic interference detection, multi-user IP detection and origin server configuration scanning.\n<br><br>\nFuture-proofing the Internet\n<br><br>\nThe Internet is evolving, both politically and technologically. This program is about building technologies and tools to anticipate the challenges that we anticipate facing over the next 3-5 years.

The process for making a contract happen isn’t that different from the software lifecycle: a cross functional group collaborates on a technical document that essentially needs to be executable - just in a courtroom instead of a computer. Most legal teams are still stuck doing things manually, emailing versions of these documents around seeking approval and revisions with no easy way to automate workflows. Simple questions like “what is blocking this contract?” can be really difficult to answer since the information is locked in someone’s inbox. That’s where Ironclad comes in.</p><p>Ironclad is the #1 contract lifecycle management platform for innovative companies. L’Oréal, Staples, Mastercard, and other leading innovators use Ironclad to collaborate and negotiate on contracts, accelerate contracting while maintaining compliance, and turn contracts into critical carriers of operational business intelligence. It’s the only platform flexible enough to handle every type of contract workflow, whether a sales agreement, an HR agreement, or a complex NDA. The company was named one of the 20 Rising Stars on the Forbes 2019 Cloud 100 list, and is backed by leading investors like Accel, Y Combinator, Sequoia, and Bond.</p><p>As a Data Analyst Intern, you will identify business problems and conduct data analysis to verify solutions.

As of 2011, there are 42 free trade agreements registered which cover 237 bilateral relationships and approximately 89% of the region’s trade volume. This scenario provides outstanding opportunities to deepen the regional integration at the level of SMEs, which account for slightly more than 10% of intra-regional trade, and yet have a vast importance to the region’s economy (they represent more than 90% of the region’s companies and more than 50% of total employment). In this context, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has made it an institutional priority to strengthen the international investment and commercial ties of SMEs in the region.\n<br><br>\nIn addition, Internet usage in Latin America and the Caribbean grew nearly 891% in the past decade.

It was launched in March 2014 and currently has over 270,000 businesspeople from over 120 countries registered on the platform, and over 2 million users from 200 countries have accessed its content.\n<br><br>\n<b>CA allows users to:</b><br>\nPublish or apply to purchasing announcements from companies and government entities\n<br>Find clients, suppliers or partners, applying filter (sector, country, verification status) to a database of registered companies\n<br>Discover business support services in their countries\n<br>Sign up for business events in their countries and the rest of the world\n<br>Apply to receive financing from banks in the region\n<br>Strengthen their skills through articles, videos and free online courses\n<br><br>\nCA was developed and promoted by the IDB with support from its anchor partners (Google, DHL, Facebook, SeaLand and MasterCard), and over 300 business support organizations within and beyond LAC.
