Our team members provide their expertise to ensure customer success through the design, development and execution of innovative and comprehensive test, verification and validation strategies, processes, tools and techniques. SI&amp;T employees are involved in all aspects of test including: design-for-test, integration, subsystem, and component level testing through Customer sell-off of our most sophisticated systems and technologies.\n<br><br>\nSystems Engineering Intern\n<br><br>\nWhat is Systems Engineering? What does a Systems Engineer do? Systems Engineering contributes to programs throughout the entire product development lifecycle, from inception through development, sell-off, deployment, and operations and maintenance in the field.\n<br><br>\nSystems Engineers work within an interdisciplinary process that ensures that the customer's needs are satisfied throughout a system's entire life cycle. This process is comprised of the following seven tasks:\n<br><br>\n1. State the problem. Stating the problem is the most important systems engineering task. It entails identifying customers, understanding customer needs, establishing the need for change, discovering requirements, and defining system functions.\n<br><br>\n2. Investigate alternatives. Alternatives are investigated and evaluated based on performance, cost, and risk.\n<br><br>\n3. Model the system. Running models clarifies requirements, reveals bottlenecks and fragmented activities, reduces cost and exposes duplication of efforts.\n<br><br>\n4. Integrate. Integration means designing interfaces and bringing system elements together so they work as a whole. This requires extensive communication and coordination.\n<br><br>\n5. Launch the system. Launching the system means running the system and producing outputs to verify that the system does what it was intended to do.\n<br><br>\n6. Assess performance. Performance is assessed using figures of merit, technical performance measures, and metrics - measurement is the key. If you cannot measure it, you cannot control it. If you cannot control it, you cannot improve it.\n<br><br>\n7. Re-evaluation. Re-evaluation should be a continual and iterative process with many parallel loops.\n<br><br>\nJob Description\n<br><br>\nOpportunities for Interns require individuals to use engineering, math, and teamwork skills to perform various engineering activities, such as requirements development, system test and validation planning and execution, modeling and simulation, data analysis, flight test analysis, and overall systems integration.

Testing includes hardware and software.\n<br><br>\nDuties could include developing test or integration strategies and procedures, debugging and testing functions and interfaces, conducting performance studies and data analysis on air defense, radar, ship or Homeland Defense systems and/or their subsystems.

We offer a unique vibrant environment that features cutting-edge academic research, enterprise software development, and real-world delivery, with close feedback loops and rapid iterations among all three, much like a lean startup.\n<br><br>\nThe setting for this internship is the exponential increase in available genotypic and phenotypic data and its implications on the future of medicine. Human genome sequencing and the advent of big data heralds a new era of precision healthcare, where medicine is tailored to individuals, reducing cost, suffering, and missed treatment opportunities. Bioinformatics and machine learning can play a key role in this transformation by discerning knowledge from data and separating signal from noise.\n<br><br>\nWe are specifically looking for a research intern with expertise in genomic association studies, i.e., taking whole genome sequencing data from a large cohort of case/control individuals and seeking markers indicative of disease. The goal of this work would be to extend this type of analysis to multiomic data, using both genotypic and phenotypic data to identify more precise markers of disease, to estimate severity of disease from features, or to model common disease trajectories.

During the 12-week internship, students are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.\n<br><br>\nAn ideal candidate would have experience working with large genomic datasets, and be sufficiently well versed in data science and related computational tools to build models from such data. Experience working with phenotypic data (EMR, claims data, etc.) would be a plus but is not required.\n<br><br>\nQualifications\n<br><br>\nIn addition to the qualifications below, you’ll need to submit a minimum of two reference letters for this position. After you submit your application, a request for letters may be sent to your list of references on your behalf. Note that reference letters cannot be requested until after you have submitted your application, and furthermore, that they might not be automatically requested for all candidates. You may wish to alert your letter writers in advance, so they will be ready to submit your letter.\n<br><br>\nRequired Qualifications\n<br>Must be enrolled in a graduate program in Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, Genetics, Genomics, Bioengineering, Biology, Computer Science, or a related field.\n<br>Participation in the Research Internship Program requires that you are physically located in the United States or Canada for the duration of the internship\n<br><br>\nPreferred Qualifications\n<br>Experience working with genomic data\n<br>Experience working with genomic association studies\n<br>Experience with data science\n<br>Experience with programming (ideally Python)\n<br><br>\nMicrosoft is an equal opportunity employer.

This process is comprised of the following seven tasks:\n<br><br>\n1. State the problem. Stating the problem is the most important systems engineering task. It entails identifying customers, understanding customer needs, establishing the need for change, discovering requirements, and defining system functions.\n<br><br>\n2. Investigate alternatives. Alternatives are investigated and evaluated based on performance, cost, and risk.\n<br><br>\n3. Model the system. Running models clarifies requirements, reveals bottlenecks and fragmented activities, reduces cost and exposes duplication of efforts.\n<br><br>\n4. Integrate.

Launching the system means running the system and producing outputs to verify that the system does what it was intended to do.\n<br><br>\n6. Assess performance. Performance is assessed using figures of merit, technical performance measures, and metrics - measurement is the key. If you cannot measure it, you cannot control it. If you cannot control it, you cannot improve it.\n<br><br>\n7. Re-evaluation. Re-evaluation should be a continual and iterative process with many parallel loops.\n<br><br>\nJob Description\n<br><br>\nOpportunities for Interns require individuals to use engineering, math, and teamwork skills to perform various engineering activities, such as requirements development, system test and validation planning and execution, modeling and simulation, data analysis, flight test analysis, and overall systems integration.
