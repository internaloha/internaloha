That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices. Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.\n<br><br>\n<b>What else you should know:</b><br>\nWe’re a publicly-traded company (TREE).\n<br>We’ve welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.\n<br>We’ve built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.\n<br>We still make funny commercials.\n<br><br>\nCULTURE\n<br><br>\nWe’re a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend.
