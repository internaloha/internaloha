The enterprise dataset is intended to integrate all of the NPS cultural resource inventory databases, allowing NPS park resource managers, regional staff and national program managers to better understand and plan for cultural resources within NPS holdings. Unrestricted portions of the data are also made available to the public through internet applications, internet data viewers and government-wide spatial data search portals.\n<br><br>\nSpatial data created in this project will delineate cultural resources described in the State, Tribal, Local, Plans and Grants database (STLPG) as well as the Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record/Historic American Landscape Survey inventory (HABS/HAER/HALS) in the NPS spatial data transfer standard format to facilitate inclusion in the NPS cultural resource enterprise GIS dataset. Additionally, this spatial data will cross-reference with other NPS databases already in the enterprise (Cultural Landscapes Inventory, List of Classified Structures and National Register of Historic Places) which may reference the same resources, but contain different descriptive or condition information.

Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.\n<br><br>\nDue regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs.
