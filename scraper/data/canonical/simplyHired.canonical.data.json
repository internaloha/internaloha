Thank you.\n<br><br>\nThis position will likely work remotely the entire summer. However, our preference is to hire someone who will be based in the Charlotte, NC area on the chance we're able to go back to office during the summer.\n<br><br>\nTHE POSITION\n<br><br>\nOur former Summer Interns will tell you, LendingTree’s Internship Program is selective, challenging and structured to push the limits of what they thought they could do - and they wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. Are there easier ways to spend your summer? Absolutely. But a LendingTree Internship will help you grow professionally and also get you closer to landing a phenomenal job once you graduate – maybe even with LendingTree. Here’s what you can expect:\n<br><br>\nReal work. The only person you’ll be getting coffee for at LendingTree is yourself. You’ll be doing professional level work that will have a real impact on the business\n<br>Training. Sure you’ll learn a ton of industry skills as you contribute to your team every day, but you’ll also go through specific training on: crafting a phenomenal resume and LinkedIn profile, getting interviews and how to handle them, how to give a great presentation and more\n<br>You’re not alone. In addition from the support from your team you’ll be assigned a Mentor outside of your department who will guide you and mentor you throughout the summer\n<br>End of summer presentation. At the end of the summer every Intern gives a PPT presentation to Executives which will include a summary of what you accomplished, what you learned and 2 ideas that will either make the company money or save the company money\n<br><br>\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n<br><br>\nOwn a project – Analyze current customer experiences. Define, and run A/B tests and optimize consumer web-based product to specific metrics.\n<br>Monitor and analyze product performance and communicate findings and recommendations for meaningful changes. Define Product requirements for actionable changes and reiterate.\n<br>Put together wireframes to support product requirements and changes to be done.\n<br>Understand scope of the internal web-based product, participate in workshops. Own feature delivery, and write product requirements by working with business and development teams.\n<br>Communicate to partners on the progress of the feature/functionality.\n<br><br>\nQUALIFICATIONS\n<br><br>\nUndergrad or grad student (3.5+ GPA required) who will be graduating in Dec. 2021 or May 2022 (GPA must be listed on your resume to be considered).\n<br><b>Preferred majors:</b> Business, Information Technology, Computer Science.\n<br>Proficient in Excel (Pivot Tables, VLOOKUPs, etc.) and SQL\n<br>Good understanding of how APIs work.\n<br>Knowledge of Agile/Scrum product development or software development methodologies is preferred.\n<br>Willingness to roll up your sleeves and GET STUFF DONE.\n<br><br>\nCOMPANY\n<br><br>\nLendingTree is the nation’s largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices. Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.\n<br><br>\n<b>What else you should know:</b><br>\nWe’re a publicly-traded company (TREE).\n<br>We’ve welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.\n<br>We’ve built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.\n<br>We still make funny commercials.\n<br><br>\nCULTURE\n<br><br>\nWe’re a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We’re collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you’ll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, do wear clothes to work!), and we’re pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, “Get Stuff Done”). Come work with us!\n<br><br>\nLendingTree is the kind of company that not only promotes diversity and inclusion; we thrive because of these values.

Apeel is an edible protective layer that extends fruits' and vegetables' shelf-life. Apeel-covered fruits and vegetables spoil slower and require less refrigeration, and the plant-derived peel reduces the use of plastic and other products harmful to the planet. Apeel pulls material from the natural skins, peels, seeds, and pulp found on fruits and vegetables, to create the extra protective peel. The thin layer slows down water loss and oxidation, which can help keep those fruits and vegetables from browning and spoiling.\n<br><br>\nCompany Culture\n<br><br>\nAt Apeel Sciences, we look to nature to help the global food system improve quality, reduce waste, and ensure an abundant future for our planet. Apeel is comprised of highly talented, deeply passionate, and tight-knit team members who are excited by the opportunity to challenge the status quo, obsessed with solving problems, and truly seek to positively change how we feed the world.\n<br><br>\nOur people are fundamental to our company's success and continued growth.

        "description": "<div class=\"h3\">Full Job Description</div><div class=\"p\">Company Background\n<br><br>\nSince 2012, founder James Rogers has been on a mission to tackle the global Food Waste Crisis with a goal of providing a more sustainable, equitable path forward for the global food system. Apeel is an edible protective layer that extends fruits' and vegetables' shelf-life. Apeel-covered fruits and vegetables spoil slower and require less refrigeration, and the plant-derived peel reduces the use of plastic and other products harmful to the planet. Apeel pulls material from the natural skins, peels, seeds, and pulp found on fruits and vegetables, to create the extra protective peel. The thin layer slows down water loss and oxidation, which can help keep those fruits and vegetables from browning and spoiling.\n<br><br>\nCompany Culture\n<br><br>\nAt Apeel Sciences, we look to nature to help the global food system improve quality, reduce waste, and ensure an abundant future for our planet. Apeel is comprised of highly talented, deeply passionate, and tight-knit team members who are excited by the opportunity to challenge the status quo, obsessed with solving problems, and truly seek to positively change how we feed the world.\n<br><br>\nOur people are fundamental to our company's success and continued growth.

Apeel-covered fruits and vegetables spoil slower and require less refrigeration, and the plant-derived peel reduces the use of plastic and other products harmful to the planet. Apeel pulls material from the natural skins, peels, seeds, and pulp found on fruits and vegetables, to create the extra protective peel. The thin layer slows down water loss and oxidation, which can help keep those fruits and vegetables from browning and spoiling.\n<br><br>\nCompany Culture\n<br><br>\nAt Apeel Sciences, we look to nature to help the global food system improve quality, reduce waste, and ensure an abundant future for our planet.

Thank you.\n<br><br>\nThis position will likely work remotely the entire summer. However, our preference is to hire someone who will be based in the Charlotte, NC area on the chance we're able to go back to office during the summer.\n<br><br>\nTHE POSITION\n<br><br>\nOur former Summer Interns will tell you, LendingTree's Internship Program is selective, challenging and structured to push the limits of what they thought they could do - and they wouldn't have wanted it any other way. Are there easier ways to spend your summer? Absolutely. But a LendingTree Internship will help you grow professionally and also get you closer to landing a phenomenal job once you graduate – maybe even with LendingTree. Here's what you can expect:\n<br><br>\nReal work. The only person you'll be getting coffee for at LendingTree is yourself. You'll be doing professional level work that will have a real impact on the business\n<br>Training. Sure you'll learn a ton of industry skills as you contribute to your team every day, but you'll also go through specific training on: crafting a phenomenal resume and LinkedIn profile, getting interviews and how to handle them, how to give a great presentation and more\n<br>You're not alone. In addition from the support from your team you'll be assigned a Mentor outside of your department who will guide you and mentor you throughout the summer\n<br>End of summer presentation. At the end of the summer every Intern gives a PPT presentation to Executives which will include a summary of what you accomplished, what you learned and 2 ideas that will either make the company money or save the company money\n<br><br>\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n<br><br>\nOwn a project – Analyze current customer experiences. Define, and run A/B tests and optimize consumer web-based product to specific metrics.\n<br>Monitor and analyze product performance and communicate findings and recommendations for meaningful changes. Define Product requirements for actionable changes and reiterate.\n<br>Put together wireframes to support product requirements and changes to be done.\n<br>Understand scope of the internal web-based product, participate in workshops. Own feature delivery, and write product requirements by working with business and development teams.\n<br>Communicate to partners on the progress of the feature/functionality.\n<br><br>\nQUALIFICATIONS\n<br><br>\nUndergrad or grad student (3.5+ GPA required) who will be graduating in Dec. 2021 or May 2022 (GPA must be listed on your resume to be considered).\n<br><b>Preferred majors:</b> Business, Information Technology, Computer Science.\n<br>Proficient in Excel (Pivot Tables, VLOOKUPs, etc.) and SQL\n<br>Good understanding of how APIs work.\n<br>Knowledge of Agile/Scrum product development or software development methodologies is preferred.\n<br>Willingness to roll up your sleeves and GET STUFF DONE.\n<br><br>\nCOMPANY\n<br><br>\nLendingTree is the nation's largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices. Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.\n<br><br>\n<b>What else you should know:</b><br>\nWe're a publicly-traded company (TREE).\n<br>We've welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.\n<br>We've built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.\n<br>We still make funny commercials.\n<br><br>\nCULTURE\n<br><br>\nWe're a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We're collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you'll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, do wear clothes to work!), and we're pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, \"Get Stuff Done\"). Come work with us!\n<br><br>\nLendingTree is the kind of company that not only promotes diversity and inclusion; we thrive because of these values.

Thank you.\n<br><br>\nThis position will likely work remotely the entire summer. However, our preference is to hire someone who will be based in the Charlotte, NC area on the chance we're able to go back to office during the summer.\n<br><br>\nTHE POSITION\n<br><br>\nOur former Summer Interns will tell you, LendingTree’s Internship Program is selective, challenging and structured to push the limits of what they thought they could do - and they wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. Are there easier ways to spend your summer? Absolutely. But a LendingTree Internship will help you grow professionally and also get you closer to landing a phenomenal job once you graduate – maybe even with LendingTree. Here’s what you can expect:\n<br><br>\nReal work. The only person you’ll be getting coffee for at LendingTree is yourself. You’ll be doing professional level work that will have a real impact on the business\n<br>Training. Sure you’ll learn a ton of industry skills as you contribute to your team every day, but you’ll also go through specific training on: crafting a phenomenal resume and LinkedIn profile, getting interviews and how to handle them, how to give a great presentation and more\n<br>You’re not alone. In addition from the support from your team you’ll be assigned a Mentor outside of your department who will guide you and mentor you throughout the summer\n<br>End of summer presentation. At the end of the summer every Intern gives a PPT presentation to Executives which will include a summary of what you accomplished, what you learned and 2 ideas that will either make the company money or save the company money\n<br><br>\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n<br><br>\nOwn a project – Analyze current customer experiences. Define, and run A/B tests and optimize consumer web-based product to specific metrics.\n<br>Monitor and analyze product performance and communicate findings and recommendations for meaningful changes. Define Product requirements for actionable changes and reiterate.\n<br>Put together wireframes to support product requirements and changes to be done.\n<br>Understand scope of the internal web-based product, participate in workshops. Own feature delivery, and write product requirements by working with business and development teams.\n<br>Communicate to partners on the progress of the feature/functionality.\n<br><br>\nQUALIFICATIONS\n<br><br>\nUndergrad or grad student (3.5+ GPA required) who will be graduating in Dec. 2021 or May 2022 (GPA must be listed on your resume to be considered).\n<br><b>Preferred majors:</b> Business, Information Technology, Computer Science.\n<br>Proficient in Excel (Pivot Tables, VLOOKUPs, etc.) and SQL\n<br>Good understanding of how APIs work.\n<br>Knowledge of Agile/Scrum product development or software development methodologies is preferred.\n<br>Willingness to roll up your sleeves and GET STUFF DONE.\n<br><br>\nCOMPANY\n<br><br>\nLendingTree is the nation’s largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices. Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.\n<br><br>\n<b>What else you should know:</b><br>\nWe’re a publicly-traded company (TREE).\n<br>We’ve welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.\n<br>We’ve built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.\n<br>We still make funny commercials.\n<br><br>\nCULTURE\n<br><br>\nWe’re a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We’re collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you’ll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, do wear clothes to work!), and we’re pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, “Get Stuff Done”). Come work with us!\n<br><br>\nLendingTree is the kind of company that not only promotes diversity and inclusion; we thrive because of these values. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion (or creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or military status.</div><div></div>"

Apeel-covered fruits and vegetables spoil slower and require less refrigeration, and the plant-derived peel reduces the use of plastic and other products harmful to the planet.

Apeel is an edible protective layer that extends fruits' and vegetables' shelf-life. Apeel-covered fruits and vegetables spoil slower and require less refrigeration, and the plant-derived peel reduces the use of plastic and other products harmful to the planet. Apeel pulls material from the natural skins, peels, seeds, and pulp found on fruits and vegetables, to create the extra protective peel. The thin layer slows down water loss and oxidation, which can help keep those fruits and vegetables from browning and spoiling.\n<br><br>\nCompany Culture\n<br><br>\nAt Apeel Sciences, we look to nature to help the global food system improve quality, reduce waste, and ensure an abundant future for our planet. Apeel is comprised of highly talented, deeply passionate, and tight-knit team members who are excited by the opportunity to challenge the status quo, obsessed with solving problems, and truly seek to positively change how we feed the world.\n<br><br>\nOur people are fundamental to our company's success and continued growth.

You'll be doing professional level work that will have a real impact on the business\n<br>Training.

In addition from the support from your team you'll be assigned a Mentor outside of your department who will guide you and mentor you throughout the summer\n<br>End of summer presentation.

That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance.

In addition from the support from your team you’ll be assigned a Mentor outside of your department who will guide you and mentor you throughout the summer\n<br>End of summer presentation.
