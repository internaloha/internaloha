        "description": "<div class=\"h3\">Full Job Description</div><div class=\"p\">The Experience\n<br><br>\nHere at University Growth Fund, we give students an unparalleled learning experience. Students have opportunities close to that of a partner or director at a venture capital or buyout firm. Students meet directly with the entrepreneurs and other investors, asking the hard questions as they drill down to the company’s investment attractiveness. The students drive the due diligence process forward and ultimately play a key role in determining whether or not UGF invests from it multi-million dollar fund. Once an investment is made, students often have the opportunity to sit in an observer role on the board of the company and see firsthand how successful companies are managed and operated. Student associates are also able to add additional value to the company over time through various value-add research and strategy projects. Meeting with entrepreneurs and investors, sitting on boards, sourcing new deals are all ways in which students are able to build an extensive network and gain new experiences and skills.\n<br><br>\nThe Program\n<br><br>\nStudents are brought on for one semester as interns. Those that perform well are invited to stay on in the Fund and are promoted to associate. Associates take on a more autonomous role and have more freedom and flexibility to choose the projects they work on. During this time, associates work to refine an investment area of expertise. After approximately one year, associates who perform well are promoted to senior associate. Senior associates lead the deals and projects at University Growth Fund and maintain relationships with the entrepreneurs and other investors in the deal.\n<br><br>\nTraining\n<br><br>\nNew UGF interns are brought up to speed on the industry through an accelerated 7-week training program to teach them the basics of VC and PE investing. From there, UGF provides additional training to help students further refine their skills and areas of expertise. Senior associates enjoy a more individualized training program that provides a deeper dive into investment and business issues through a more mentored approach. However, Not all training is focused purely on VC and PE investing. UGF creates an individualized career preparation program for each new student with the express goal of helping that student achieve their career aspirations. In addition, UGF provides other opportunities to learn and grow through subsidized trips and access to numerous conferences throughout the year like the Consumer Electronics Show, ACG Utah, and Techcrunch50.\n<br><br>\nRecruiting\n<br><br>\nWe are on the constant lookout for those that will be the next generation of entrepreneurial leaders. These future leaders come from a diverse set of backgrounds including Finance, Biology, English, Math, Computer Science, Engineering, Economics, and so on. Many of our student associates plan to pursue careers in entrepreneurship, intrapreneurship, investment banking, management consulting, private equity and venture capital. We look for students for whom we can add a lot of value, because their goals are correctly aligned with our program and because they have the drive to succeed and take full advantage of our program. The two basic traits we look for in all candidates are:\n<br><br>\n<b>Intellectual Horsepower:</b> The ability to think analytically and strategically is key in our area of investing. One must often attempt to predict the future with very little information and make crucial decisions that have a real impact on our organization’s investment performance. In addition, there is a steep learning curve here at UGF, one that will require your very best.\n<br><br>\n<b>Desire:</b> This is an unpaid internship, and like most good things in life, you will get from it what you put in. This might entail “pulling an all-nighter” to finish a deal analysis in time to make the close date on the investment. It will mean monetary and leisure sacrifices. But for those that have the desire, they will gain experiences others only dream of.</div><div></div>"

Tacoma embraces its multi-cultural and multi-ethnic character. Communities of color and immigrant communities are fundamental to Tacoma's entrepreneurial spirit, workforce, and long-term success. In Tacoma, equity and empowerment are top priorities, meaning that all Tacoma residents must have equitable opportunities to reach their full potential and share in the benefits of community progress. One of our goals is for the City of Tacoma workforce to reflect the community it serves. We actively work to eliminate racial and other disparities and welcome candidates with diverse backgrounds and/or multicultural skill sets and experiences. Our goal is for Tacoma to be an inclusive and equitable place to live, work, and play.\n<br><br>\nThe City of Tacoma is an Equal Opportunity Employer and values diversity in its workplace. Applicants are considered for positions without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital or veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other basis prohibited by federal, state, and local laws.\n<br><br>\nThe City of Tacoma\n<br>Tacoma is a mid-sized urban port city that sits along the Puget Sound with a population of nearly 210,000. The third largest city in the state of Washington, it is a diverse, progressive international gateway to the Pacific Rim.\n<br><br>\nPropelled by significant developments such as the University of Washington Tacoma, the Tacoma Link light rail system, the restored urban waterfront of the Thea Foss Waterway, the expansions of both the MultiCare and Franciscan health systems, and a significant influx of foreign direct investment in its downtown core, Tacoma has evolved considerably since the 1990s.\n<br><br>\nTacoma boasts the state's highest density of art and history museums, and is home to a flourishing creative community of writers, artists, musicians, photographers, filmmakers, chefs, entrepreneurs, and small business owners who each add their unique flair to the city's vibrant commercial landscape. The iconic Tacoma Dome has endured as a high-demand venue for some of the largest names in the entertainment industry.\n<br><br>\nA magnet for families looking for affordable housing options in the Puget Sound area, Tacoma also draws those who prefer to live in a more urban downtown setting with competitively priced condos and apartments that feature panoramic mountain and water views.\n<br><br>\nTacoma's natural beauty and proximity to the Puget Sound and Mount Rainier draws hikers, runners, bicyclists, and maritime enthusiasts to the area.

Thank you.\n<br><br>\nThis position will likely work remotely the entire summer. However, our preference is to hire someone who will be based in the Charlotte, NC area on the chance we're able to go back to office during the summer.\n<br><br>\nTHE POSITION\n<br><br>\nOur former Summer Interns will tell you, LendingTree’s Internship Program is selective, challenging and structured to push the limits of what they thought they could do - and they wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. Are there easier ways to spend your summer? Absolutely. But a LendingTree Internship will help you grow professionally and also get you closer to landing a phenomenal job once you graduate – maybe even with LendingTree. Here’s what you can expect:\n<br><br>\nReal work. The only person you’ll be getting coffee for at LendingTree is yourself. You’ll be doing professional level work that will have a real impact on the business\n<br>Training. Sure you’ll learn a ton of industry skills as you contribute to your team every day, but you’ll also go through specific training on: creating a great resume and LinkedIn profile, getting interviews and how to handle them, how to give a great presentation and more\n<br>You’re not alone. In addition from the support from your team you’ll be assigned a Mentor outside of your department who will guide you and mentor you throughout the summer\n<br>End of summer presentation. At the end of the summer every Intern gives a PPT presentation to Executives which will include a summary of what you accomplished, what you learned and 2 ideas that will either make the company money or save the company money\n<br><br>\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n<br><br>\nWork with other software engineers to implement code enhancements, new features and fixes\n<br>Work on cutting-edge problems and architecture related to designing scalable and robust micro-services\n<br>Build and develop new unit testing strategies for code that you write, ensuring maximum coverage and future extensibility\n<br>Assist with ad-hoc code analysis, analyze time complexities and come up with better algorithms\n<br>Own your work through all its stages (Requirement Gathering/Clarification, Code Analysis, Design and Development, Unit Testing, Helping QA Automate regression, Help support deployment scripts (we use Docker), Help with release and post-performance monitoring)\n<br><br>\nQUALIFICATIONS\n<br><br>\nSummer Internships at LendingTree are not open to students who will require sponsorship now or at any point in the future\n<br>Very bright (3.7+ GPA required) undergrad or grad student who will be graduating in December 2021 or May 2022 (GPA must be listed on your resume to be considered)\n<br><b>Preferred major:</b> Computer Science or closely related field\n<br>Ability to write code using dotnet/C# or Java\n<br>Strong knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts\n<br>Knowledge of algorithms and standard Design Patterns\n<br>Motivated self-starter, with a high capacity for rapid learning and meticulous attention to detail\n<br>Willingness to roll up sleeves and GET STUFF DONE!\n<br><br>\nCOMPANY\n<br><br>\nLendingTree is the nation’s largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices. Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.\n<br><br>\n<b>What else you should know:</b><br>\nWe’re a publicly-traded company (TREE).\n<br>We’ve welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.\n<br>We’ve built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.\n<br>We still make funny commercials.\n<br><br>\nCULTURE\n<br><br>\nWe’re a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We’re collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you’ll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, do wear clothes to work!), and we’re pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, “Get Stuff Done”).
