        "description": "<div class=\"h3\">Full Job Description</div><div class=\"p\">We are looking for a summer intern to investigate and develop automated methods for characterizing the security of applications that are developed using continuous development (DevSecOps)!\n<br><br>\nThis task includes security profiling during code production, integration, testing, delivery, and assessment. You will learn to determine the security profile of applications by processing the language that describes tasks and functions that get implemented in the software modules. Such descriptions are typically available from project lifecycle management platforms such as Jira or Gitlab. Given the variety of methods to define application functionality, you will deal with code descriptions presented in natural language, as well as in structured and semi-structured formats. Hence, you will get an opportunity to execute tools for Natural Language Processing and static code analysis. You will build additional tools to generate security code policy description files in a standard format (e.g., JSON).\n<br><br>\nThe internship will focus mostly on network communication, i.e., the policy files will contain list of servers that need to be accessed by each software module, network communication flows (i.e., network ports, addresses, protocols) established towards other resources or peer nodes, business or domain-specific process flows followed by the clients and servers, and edge cases for communications that might incur during code maintenance processes.\n<br><br>\nFurthermore, you will build a mechanism to use the policy files above as a descriptor to configure a network flow monitor installed on the same network as the profiled application. The goal of the project is to improve automating the steps required for DevSecOps by adopting a fine-grained characterization of software modules. This will increase awareness of security during code production.\n<br><br>\nThe Challenge\n<br>Install and maintain a DevOps testbed for testing based on Jira and Gitlab, and a sample open application under development\n<br>Develop methods to access the APIs of Project Lifecycle Management (APM) platforms, e.g., Jira REST API\n<br>Use the APIs to extract code descriptions and collect them in a database, reporting versioning, bugs, fixes, snippets and analytics\n<br>Determine and understand methods to characterize the code and textual descriptions, using tools such as SrcML\n<br>Build tools to generate code behavior descriptor files using JSON\n<br>Create an interface to command a network monitor based on the file JSON above\n<br>Install a code execution and monitoring testbed, running a network monitor\n<br><br>\nThe Candidate\n<br>A current student pursuing a MS/PhD degree in Computer Science / Computer Engineering, or other related subject with a strong focus on IT-Security or Cybersecurity. Please note, you must still be enrolled as a student during the internship period to qualify for the position.\n<br>Experience with APIs to access web applications\n<br>Experience with Jira and Gitlab, or similar platforms\n<br>Experience with Linux and command lines\n<br>Experience with network monitoring tools, IPTable or network monitoring libraries\n<br>Software development skills (i.e. Python, Java or C/C++)\n<br>Prior experience with natural language processing and/or code profiling a significant plus\n<br>Ability to give presentations about sophisticated technical topics\n<br>Excellent knowledge of English (spoken and written)\n<br><br>\nSuccessful candidate must be able to work with controlled technology in accordance with US Export Control Law. US Export Control laws and applicable regulations govern the distribution of strategically important technology, services and information to foreign nationals and foreign countries. Siemens may require candidates under consideration for employment opportunities to submit information regarding citizenship status to allow the organization to comply with specific US Export Control laws and regulations.

An internship with Siemens Technology is a great opportunity for students to gain real world experience in a diverse work environment!\n<br><br>\nWhile we prefer the internship to be on site in our lab in Princeton, NJ, the uncertain future course of the pandemic makes it likely that this internship will need to happen entirely remotely. Hence, we offer this as a remote internship and thus encourage applicants from across the country.\n<br><br>\n#LI-DM4\n<br><br>\n<b>Organization:</b> Technology\n<br><br>\n<b>Company:</b> Siemens Corporation\n<br><br>\n<b>Experience Level:</b> Student (Not Yet Graduated)\n<br><br>\n<b>Job Type:</b> Full-time\n<br><br>\nEqual Employment Opportunity Statement\n<br>Siemens is an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Employer encouraging diversity in the workplace.
