We began as a freight forwarding company in 1850, earning a reputation as a company people could trust while transporting some of their most valuable possessions. In the late 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century and early 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, we introduced new financial products and travel services that helped support our customers’ everyday lives. In the 1950s, we introduced a charge card, offering customers a new and convenient way to pay. Ever since, we’ve innovated our card products, our services and our other offerings. Today, American Express is the largest global payments network and we continue to pride ourselves on being forward-looking and customer-focused.</span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"MsoNoSpacing\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><b><i>With each new development, one thing has remained constant: our commitment to our customers and our special brand of service.</i></b></span></span></p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify; margin-top:2px\"><strong><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">About the American Express Discovery Program:</span></span></span></strong></h3>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\">The <b>American Express Discovery Program (ADP)</b> is a two-day exploratory program hosted virtually providing students the opportunity to learn more about American Express.
