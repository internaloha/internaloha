        "description": "<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is looking for a Software Development Engineer Intern to be part of the Arlington HQ2 based AWS AppConfig team. AWS AppConfig is a brand new product that is changing the way customers think about configuration and code.<br><br>It all started a few years back when we identified a need to make configuration changes faster than traditional code deployments, but with the same operational scrutiny as code changes. So, we built a tool to address this need and now most teams across AWS, Amazon.com, Kindle, and Alexa use this configuration deployment system to perform changes dynamically in seconds, rather than minutes. A common question we receive from customers is how they can operate like us, so we decided to take this internal tool and launched AppConfig for customer use.<br><br>Developers at Amazon work on real world problems on a global scale, own their systems end-to-end, and influence the direction of our technology that impacts hundreds of millions customers around the world. Join a team of super smart, customer obsessed developers that think big and have fun.<br><br>This role will sit in our new headquarters in Northern Virginia, where Amazon will invest $2.5 billion dollars, occupy 4 million square feet of energy efficient office space, and create at least 25,000 new full-time jobs. Our employees and the neighboring community will also benefit from the associated investments from the Commonwealth including infrastructure updates, public transportation improvements, and new access to Reagan National Airport.<br><br>Join a team of super smart, customer obsessed Developers that like to have fun in a start-up like environment.<br><br><br><br></p>"
