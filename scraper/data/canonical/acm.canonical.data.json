In addition, the intern will be given selected engineering work assignments to reinforce the learning experience and to provide benefit to the work unit. The engineering assignments may include designing components, developing a project strategy, gathering user needs, requirements and specifications, evaluating commercial components, assembling prototype systems, performing design verification and design validation, troubleshooting, and participating in design reviews. All assignments are within the context of the Division of Engineering Quality Management System (including safety risk management) and are performed in a multi-disciplinary development environment.
