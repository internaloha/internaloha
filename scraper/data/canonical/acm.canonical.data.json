The advantage of being a Systems Engineer is its broad scope within any given space program. This discipline also exists in all phases of a standard program as well (Pre-Proposal, Proposal Writing, Requirements/Verification Maturation, Bus/Payload Development, Software testing, Assembly, Integration and Testing, Launch Operations, Mission Operations). Not only is this advantageous from a discipline perspective (you get to be involved in all phases of the program), but the sheer number of programs on campus means that everyone stays extremely busy!
