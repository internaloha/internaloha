Together with your team you will craft from top to bottom the suite of innovative products that make Meraki unique.</p><br><h2>Intern Program Overview:</h2><p>Meraki interns and co-ops join the team for 12 and 16 week programs, respectively, and are placed directly onto subteams. During the program, interns/co-ops have the opportunity to work on a small starter project, such as integration and implementation of new tools, before spending the bulk of the program on a larger project, such as building the infrastructure for a new service. Projects are multi-functional, which allow insight into new languages and technologies, help encourage professional growth within engineering, and allow a sense of ownership within the team.</p><br><p>Merakis engineering teams place a high emphasis on mentorship. Each intern and co-op is matched 1:1 with a mentor who provides continual feedback and guidance throughout the duration of the program.
