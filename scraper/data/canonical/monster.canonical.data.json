The Resource Assistants Program (RAP) provides flexible internship placements based in National Forests across the US for those interested in Forest Service careers. Resource Assistants work under the mentorship and coaching of Forest Service staff to complete mission-critical work while developing leadership, critical thinking, and strategic communication skills. The RAP was designed for emerging professionals to launch their natural and cultural resources careers.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\">Each MobilizeGreen Resource Assistant starts their journey with a weeklong orientation, where they will meet other RAs and Forest Service staff from across the country and engage in skill building and career development activities. Once an RA arrives at their host site, they are supervised and mentored by a variety of Forest Service staff, engaging with experts from business, conservation, and science backgrounds, and learning more about careers as they work on vital projects within the Forest Service. Upon completion of the program, RAs receive a 2-year direct hiring certificate with the Forest Service, keeping the door open for exciting career opportunities with their host site, or with any of the 154 national forests across the country. MobilizeGreen will enhance your career opportunities, introduce you to key leaders in the natural resource field, and engage you on your career journey to a job with the Forest Service.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"><strong>Position Abstract:</strong> In partnership with the Daniel Boone National Forest and the Forest Service Minerals and Geology Management program, MobilizeGreen seeks a Resource Assistant (RA) intern to help forest staff oversee mineral exploration, development, and reclamation activities related to federal (government owned) and nonfederal (privately owned) mineral estates according to specific authorities, legislation, rules, and regulations.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"></p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"><strong>Work Environment:</strong>The Resource Assistants work under the mentorship and coaching of Forest Service staff to complete mission-critical work while developing leadership, critical thinking, and strategic communication skills.

The Resource Assistants Program (RAP) provides flexible internship placements based in National Forests across the US for those interested in Forest Service careers. Resource Assistants work under the mentorship and coaching of Forest Service staff to complete mission-critical work while developing leadership, critical thinking, and strategic communication skills. The RAP was designed for emerging professionals to launch their natural and cultural resources careers.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\">Each MobilizeGreen Resource Assistant starts their journey with a weeklong orientation, where they will meet other RAs and Forest Service staff from across the country and engage in skill building and career development activities. Once an RA arrives at their host site, they are supervised and mentored by a variety of Forest Service staff, engaging with experts from business, conservation, and science backgrounds, and learning more about careers as they work on vital projects within the Forest Service. Upon completion of the program, RAs receive a 2-year direct hiring certificate with the Forest Service, keeping the door open for exciting career opportunities with their host site, or with any of the 154 national forests across the country. MobilizeGreen will enhance your career opportunities, introduce you to key leaders in the natural resource field, and engage you on your career journey to a job with the Forest Service.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"><strong>Position Abstract:</strong> In partnership with the Daniel Boone National Forest and the Forest Service Minerals and Geology Management program, MobilizeGreen seeks a Resource Assistant (RA) intern to help forest staff oversee mineral exploration, development, and reclamation activities related to federal (government owned) and nonfederal (privately owned) mineral estates according to specific authorities, legislation, rules, and regulations.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"></p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"><strong>Work Environment:</strong>The Resource Assistants work under the mentorship and coaching of Forest Service staff to complete mission-critical work while developing leadership, critical thinking, and strategic communication skills.

The Resource Assistants Program (RAP) provides flexible internship placements based in National Forests across the US for those interested in Forest Service careers.

The RAP was designed for emerging professionals to launch their natural and cultural resources careers.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\">Each MobilizeGreen Resource Assistant starts their journey with a weeklong orientation, where they will meet other RAs and Forest Service staff from across the country and engage in skill building and career development activities. Once an RA arrives at their host site, they are supervised and mentored by a variety of Forest Service staff, engaging with experts from business, conservation, and science backgrounds, and learning more about careers as they work on vital projects within the Forest Service. Upon completion of the program, RAs receive a 2-year direct hiring certificate with the Forest Service, keeping the door open for exciting career opportunities with their host site, or with any of the 154 national forests across the country.

Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the <strong>Allen</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Institute</strong> focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size%3A+10.0pt\">The mission of the Allen Institute for Brain Science is to accelerate the understanding of how the human brain works in health and disease. Using a big science approach, we generate useful public resources, drive technological and analytical advances, and discover fundamental brain properties through integration of experiments, modeling and theory. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size%3A+10.0pt\">We are seeking a summer intern to join the Neural Coding department for the summer of 2021. They will work on measuring cell-type specific patterns of myelination with machine learning. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size%3A+10.0pt\">Myelin is a striking feature of neuronal structure where oligodendrocytes wrap axons in order to speed action potential propagation and minimizing the energy costs of electrical impulses.&nbsp; Although we know that cells in the cortex show a diverse pattern of myelination, there are few comprehensive pictures of the patterns of myelination across individual cells.&nbsp; The large-scale electron microscopy datasets that the Allen Institute has acquired has the potential to provide insight into the structural of myelination across individual neurons across the vast diversity of cortical cell types. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size%3A+10.0pt\">In this project, the intern will focus on building an automated, machine learning-driven pipeline to detect the state of myelination across the axon of individual neurons.&nbsp; The intern will explore using methods of image-based detection of myelination and transferring them to our existing automated segmentation of neurons, as well as methods that operate directly on the existing mesh-based reconstructions. Once developed, the intern will deploy this tool to a diverse set of cortical cell types to create some of the first systematic maps of myelination across individual neurons in the mammalian brain. We hope these maps will provide insight into the function of individual cell types and help us establish quantitative metrics which distinguish individual cell types. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size%3A+10.0pt\">The Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences, and backgrounds.

Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the <strong>Allen</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Institute</strong> focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.</span></p>\n      \n      <p><span style=\"font-size%3A+10.0pt\">The mission of the Allen Institute for Brain Science is to accelerate the understanding of how the human brain works in health and disease. Using a big science approach, we generate useful public resources, drive technological and analytical advances, and discover fundamental brain properties through integration of experiments, modeling and theory. </span></p>\n      \n      <p><span style=\"font-size%3A+10.0pt\">We are seeking a summer intern to join the Neural Coding department for the summer of 2021. They will work on measuring cell-type specific patterns of myelination with machine learning. </span></p>\n      \n      <p><span style=\"font-size%3A+10.0pt\">Myelin is a striking feature of neuronal structure where oligodendrocytes wrap axons in order to speed action potential propagation and minimizing the energy costs of electrical impulses.&nbsp; Although we know that cells in the cortex show a diverse pattern of myelination, there are few comprehensive pictures of the patterns of myelination across individual cells.&nbsp; The large-scale electron microscopy datasets that the Allen Institute has acquired has the potential to provide insight into the structural of myelination across individual neurons across the vast diversity of cortical cell types. </span></p>\n      \n      <p><span style=\"font-size%3A+10.0pt\">In this project, the intern will focus on building an automated, machine learning-driven pipeline to detect the state of myelination across the axon of individual neurons.&nbsp; The intern will explore using methods of image-based detection of myelination and transferring them to our existing automated segmentation of neurons, as well as methods that operate directly on the existing mesh-based reconstructions. Once developed, the intern will deploy this tool to a diverse set of cortical cell types to create some of the first systematic maps of myelination across individual neurons in the mammalian brain. We hope these maps will provide insight into the function of individual cell types and help us establish quantitative metrics which distinguish individual cell types. </span></p>\n      \n      <p><span style=\"font-size%3A+10.0pt\">The Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences, and backgrounds.
