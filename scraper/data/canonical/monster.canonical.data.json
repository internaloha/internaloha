RPA systems develop automation code by watching a user perform a task in the applications graphical<br>user interface (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI.<br>This is a summer intern position in the GLOBALFOUNDRIES FAB 10 engineering team to map business processes so they<br>can be automated using a RPA, robotic process automation software. In this role, the individual will be responsible for mapping and automating manual business processes. Today FAB 10 engineers and technicians access multiple applications to determine how to disposition semiconductor wafers in our 24 x 7 x 365 manufacturing FAB. Semiconductor wafers may go on-hold, or be inhibited from running due to a failed measurement, or other issue. Our engineers and technicians will review data in our SPC, Statistical Process Control, system, MES, manufacturing execution systems, and CMMS, common maintenance management systems, to determine if the hold or inhibit can be released. The candidate will be embedded with engineers and technicians to record the steps taken to access these systems and the logic taken to decide if a hold or inhibit should be released. The candidate will record and document each key-stroke and validate the documented process. This set of instructions will then be used to set up workflow in a RPA, Robotic Process Automation application to automate the manual actions. The candidate will validate the RPA application and will work with IT personnel to deploy it into production. The candidate will be pursuing degrees in either industrial engineering, computer science, or computer engineering. The candidate will have experience in Java or other scripting languages. The candidate will collaborate with other engineering team members to develop BALDY enhancements in JAVA. The candidate will need to have excellent communication and cross-team collaboration skills. The candidate will collaborate with a diverse group of employees, including programmers, engineers, equipment maintenance technicians and manufacturing operators. The candidate will need to be a self-starter and a quick learner of new technologies.&nbsp;The candidate needs to share their work in design and code reviews. Additionally, the work needs to be documented for FAB 10 programmers to support it after the assignment has completed.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;font-family:'arial'\"><b>Essential Responsibilities:</b></p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;font-family:'arial'\">● Learn function of RPA application</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;font-family:'arial'\">● Imbed into an engineering and technician team to learn their daily standard work</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;font-family:'arial'\">● Document daily standard work used by the team</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;font-family:'arial'\">● Use Microsoft O365 to record the standard work</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;font-family:'arial'\">● Document standard work for input into RPA</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;font-family:'arial'\">● Work with IT Team to develop RPA application</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;font-family:'arial'\">● Validate RPA application operation</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;font-family:'arial'\">● Deploy into production</p></div><div></div><div id=\"requisitionDescriptionInterface.ID1518.row1\" title=\"\"><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;font-family:'arial'\"><b>Required Qualifications:</b></p><ul><li>Fluent in English</li><li>Excellent communication and cross-team collaboration skills</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Proficient in programming in Java, Python or other scripting languages</li></ul><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;font-family:'arial'\"><b>Preferred Qualifications:</b></p><ul><li>User experience with applications running on Linux</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Experience using both Perl and Java.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:justify;margin-bottom:11px;font-family:'arial'\">If you need a reasonable accommodation for any part of the employment process, please contact us by email at usaccommodations@globalfoundries.com and let us know the nature of your request and your contact information.

In addition from the support from your team you'll be assigned a Mentor outside of your department who will guide you and mentor you throughout the summer</li><li>End of summer presentation. At the end of the summer every Intern gives a PPT presentation to Executives which will include a summary of what you accomplished, what you learned and 2 ideas that will either make the company money or save the company money</li></ul><p><strong>RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p><ul><li>Own a project – Analyze current customer experiences. Define, and run A/B tests and optimize consumer web-based product to specific metrics.</li><li>Monitor and analyze product performance and communicate findings and recommendations for meaningful changes.
