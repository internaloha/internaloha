As a business unit of Cisco Systems, Meraki is the fastest growing cloud-managed networking team in the world with products and technology architecture that are changing the face of enterprise networking and making cloud-managed IT a reality. At Cisco Meraki, we’re on track to be the most successful acquisition in Cisco’s history (and certainly the most fun). Our office makes working here pretty special too. If you’re looking for a company that really commits, how about our onsite gym with weekly fitness and yoga classes, and paid time off to volunteer and give back to the community? All in all, what truly makes Meraki special are the people - people who keep the culture strong and make working here exciting, meaningful, and rewarding. As a Data Science intern, you will be a key partner in Meraki’s data ecosystem, responsible for analyzing operational data to build predictive models that drive key decisions for Meraki's internal operations teams. At Meraki, we have business problems that require us to apply machine learning and pattern recognition against large scale datasets of operational and machine-generated data. We're looking for help in solving them. As part of this role, you will develop relationships across Meraki's teams such as support, operations, business operations, and product. Ideal candidates will have an analytical mindset, mathematical, and programming skills, and a bias for action. You don't wait for change - you embody the change you want to see in the world! EXAMPLE PROJECTS OF A DATA Scientist: ● Analyze network logs over time to recognize performance issues. Can we build a machine learning model to sift through live log streams and proactively detect issues? ● How do we use historical data to accelerate sales growth? Can we predict which Meraki partners are likely to grow their business over a certain period? ● How can we use ML to optimize hardware inventory levels? Can we forecast product demand on a monthly basis a year out? ● How can we optimize the rollout of a new product? Can we calculate the probability of product acquisition for each of our customers with no historical sales data? MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS: ● Currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in computer science, engineering, economics, finance, or a technical (STEM) field ● An understanding of machine learning algorithms and basic statistical concepts (e.g. correlation, causation, regression analysis) ● Proficiency in SQL and python programming ● Ability to take initiative and work autonomously ● Strong analytical and critical thinking skills INTERN PROGRAM OVERVIEW: Meraki interns join the team for a 12-week program and are placed directly onto subteams. During the program, interns have the opportunity to work on various projects, such as integration and implementation of new tools. Projects are cross functional, which allow insight into new languages and technologies, help encourage professional growth within engineering, strategy, and support, and allow a sense of ownership within the team. Meraki’s teams place a high emphasis on mentorship. Each intern is matched 1:1 with a mentor who provides continual feedback and guidance throughout the duration of the program. Mentors help with introductions to other team members, overviews of tools and processes, and provide a seamless integration into Meraki life.

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare have all web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&nbsp;</p><p>We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that.

Come join us!&nbsp;</p></div></div><p><strong>About Cloudflare's Engineering teams</strong></p><h4>Cloudflare helps build the future of the Internet. We started Cloudflare to solve one half of every IT organization's challenge: how do you ensure the resources and infrastructure that you expose to the Internet are safe from attack, fast, and reliable. We saw that the world was moving away from hardware and software to solve these problems and instead wanted a scalable service that would work around the world.</h4><h4>To deliver that, we built one of the world's largest networks. Every day, we see more than 1 billion unique IP addresses. Anytime we push code, it automatically affects the 25 million+ Internet properties (websites, apps, APIs, etc.) running on our global network. Cloudflare's network is one of the largest in the world and spans over 200 cities in more than 100 countries. What's more, Cloudflare operates within 100 milliseconds of 99% of the Internet-connected population in the developed world (for context, the blink of an eye is 300-400 milliseconds!). We are passionate about making the Internet more secure, reliable, and faster for everyone.</h4><p>Cloudflare’s Engineering teams build and run the software that handles the massive amount of traffic that flows through our network. We also have teams that build the UI and control plane for our software, using modern patterns and libraries in a microservices-based architecture. Technologies include: C/C++, Rust, Go, Lua, Nginx, Go, Python, Typescript, JavaScript and ReactJS.</p><p><strong>About the internship program</strong></p><p>The ideal summer intern is passionate about making the internet a better place.

This is a great opportunity for engineers that want to learn to develop at Internet scale.</p><p>Aside from working on impactful projects, you will network and meet with our executives including our co-founders. All interns are paired with a mentor on the team to ramp up quickly and also with a buddy to connect with other folks across the company.

Our Tech Experience is meant to encourage smart, ambitious, tech-savvy women to break the mold. We’ve heard all the myths about FinTech—too cutthroat, too intense, too risky—but we know that’s not the case at PEAK6. We know women make outstanding developers and technologists, but there are not enough female developers in the FinTech field yet. We are changing that.</p><p>You can expect the Technology Experience to include:</p><ul><li>Working on an impactful project from concept to delivery and presenting your work to senior leadership</li><li>Developing innovative tools to integrate with our proprietary trading platform. Some examples from previous years include tooling for low-latency market data streams, a data dependency framework and visualization tool, and an analytics framework and visualization tool for application usage.</li><li>Working with a variety of languages/frameworks, such as Java, Python, Go, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and React, and technologies such as MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Airflow, Kafka, Kubernetes, and Docker</li><li>One-on-one mentorship focused on your learning and growth while progressing on your project</li><li>Education sessions to learn about financial markets and the tech behind our trading platform</li><li>Rotations and project deep-dives with our development teams</li><li>Exposure to various other PEAK6 businesses and senior leadership</li><li>Multiple opportunities to hear and learn from women in the FinTech space, both within PEAK6 and from other organizations</li><li>Integration with our development teams – including stand-ups, team meetings, and project planning sessions</li><li>Close collaboration with business stakeholders and end users on projects</li><li>Dynamic, fast-paced work environment where the need to stay ahead of the curve means you’ll learn every day</li></ul><p><br></p></div></div><div><h4>Requirements</h4><div><p>You’ll gain loads of experience in our Tech Experience but before you do, you should have:</p><ul><li>A graduation date between December 2021 – June 2022 in a Bachelor’s or Master’s program in Computer Science, Electrical or Computer Engineering, or a related discipline</li><li>Software development skills in a modern, object-oriented programming language such as Java, Python, or Go, and the ability to learn new languages and technologies quickly</li><li>Exceptional problem-solving skills with high attention to detail</li><li>Curiosity to learn and a drive to improve</li><li>Ability to thrive in collaborative environments</li><li>Effective communication skills</li><li>Demonstrated leadership ability</li></ul><p>Bonus points if:</p><ul><li>You have a background or strong interest in financial markets</li><li>You’re familiar with service-oriented software architectures and distributed systems</li><li>You have experience with multithreading and concurrent programming</li></ul><p><em>Due to the unprecedented situation of COVID-19, PEAK6 has decided to protect our current and future employees by managing our business remotely. This is inclusive of interviewing, onboarding and each role day-to-day. Please consider that our roles will not be remote long-term and will return to an office setting once we're safe to do so following the guidance of local health authorities and the CDC.</em></p></div></div><div><div>Apply for this job</div><div></div></div></div></div>"
