        "description": "<p>Have you ever wanted to know what it is like to build a startup from the ground up? If you’ve ever wanted to found your own company, or just get experience of scale at this unique stage - this is the role for you.</p>\n\n<p>In this role you will do many things that might be familiar as a Principal, Full-Stack, or another type of Engineer. What’s different about a Founding Engineer is you’re first building a company and a culture. And the customer and product follows that.</p>\n\n<p>What we really want in a Founding Engineer is someone who wants build something great from the ground up. More importantly, someone that wants to share the experience with a great team.</p>\n<h3>Who are we?</h3>\n<p>Our mission is to create calmer organizations. With Pyn, employees get more of the messages they need, and fewer of the ones they don’t. We do this by providing companies with tools for targeted, tailored communications.</p>\n\n<p>Our founders are Jon Williams and Joris Luijke. Jon previously co-founded the technology company Culture Amp. Joris helped scale the culture of Atlassian and Squarespace as their Head of People. Pyn is backed by Accel; an early investor in Facebook, Slack, Dropbox, and many more great companies.</p>\n\n<p>Pyn originates from Sydney, Australia. However, we have employees and customers across the globe. While we work remotely, we still love to get together if and when we can. Ideally our employees have good overlap with the Australian Eastern or Pacific time zones.</p>\n<h3>Your impact</h3>\n<p>As Founding Engineer, you will champion new features all the way from ideation to implementation. As this champion, you will be talking to our customers every day.</p>\n\n<p>At Pyn, you will work across the whole organization. Everything from building our Web Application, to helping customers, mentoring engineers, and building our culture.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of nuts and bolts: The Pyn Application uses React and GraphQL. The codebase is largely TypeScript and deployed on a serverless AWS infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>We expect this architecture to evolve considerably as we grow. As a Founding Engineer, you’ll be responsible for technical direction in this evolution. You will be a key part of Pyn shipping fast, scaling up, and staying secure for our customers.</p>\n<h3>What we offer</h3>\n<p>At Pyn you will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>work directly with the Founders on product direction, strategy, and execution.</li>\n<li>be part of forming our values, and a leader for the culture we are building.</li>\n<li>work with Jon and the team on the software architecture and strategy.</li>\n<li>have regular, direct contact with our customers to understand their needs.</li>\n<li>use your experience to mentor and grow other team members.</li>\n<li>* be in a dynamic remote-work environment, with flexible hours and parental leave.</li>\n<li>exercise your curiosity and grow technical, product, and people skills.</li>\n<li>continue to ship code daily (if not hourly!) to get value to customers hands as soon as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>… change the way companies communicate with their employees.</p>\n<h3>What you bring</h3>\n<p>We recognize that people and careers are a unique journey. Recognizing this, we do not have strict skill and education requirements. Whilst there will always be specific skills we see as useful, we value the whole of what you can bring to Pyn.</p>\n\n<p>As one of our most senior hires, we want to draw upon your experience. As such it’s likely you’re a number of years into your career (or careers!). Whilst a traditional engineering background will suit this, so will many others.</p>\n\n<p>We’re striving to create a diverse environment and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. If you’re curious and passionate about improving employee communications, then we’d love to hear from you.</p>"

We want to enable this in a user-friendly experience, without leaving your browser.</li>\n<li><strong>Improving our deployment process</strong> - Being able to reliably and quickly deploy changes to our hundreds of customers is critical to getting new features out and responding quickly to regressions or incidents. Our CD (continuous deployment) process is responsible for releasing tens of changes to customers everyday. As the codebase grows and the engineering team grows to 100+ engineers, we’ve needed to rearchitect parts of our CD pipeline.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>The perks/benefits below are only offered to our full-time Benchling employees</em></p>"

More here: <a href=\"http://www.stateofplace.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.stateofplace.co</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where you come in:</strong> Our Founder &amp; CEO, Dr. Mariela Alfonzo has been a thought-leader and innovator in the urban design &amp; behavior research, practice, and academic space for over 20 years. Throughout those years, she's developed unique and cross-cutting research methods, methodology, data acquisition tools, and algorithms and has run extensive statistical analyses to understand the trandisciplinary nature of what makes cities tick, how that in turn impacts us, and ultimately, how that translates into value - including health, social, environmental and economic value. She's striven to use data-driven and evidence-based approaches to both advocate for better urban design AND increase the effectiveness, cost-efficiency, and inclusiveness of the urban design and development process. Throughout it all, we've amassed a LOT of data - that as a small startup - we just haven't had the time to further mine and utilize to answer even more pressing and/or interesting questions. So we are looking for a data science intern who is ready to jump into the deep end with us, from bearing through the mundane aspects of data science to researching and implementing some of the most exhilirating and cutting edge data science techniques, specifically:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Explore hidden patterns in the State of Place data</li>\n<li>Enhance the visualization of our geospatial and built environment data</li>\n<li>Mine multiple datasets to help better understand how the built environment impacts value &amp; equity</li>\n<li>Assist in creating/refining statistical/regression/ml models for better citymaking decisions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Primary Job Requirements:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Proficiency in one or more of the following languages: Python, R, Octave, or any mathematical language.</li>\n<li>Experience using statistical software such as SPSS, Tableau, PowerBI, Excel, or similar tools. </li>\n<li>Proficiency with Geospatial data, ArcGIS, QGIS, Geopandas, Shapely or similar library. </li>\n<li>Has familiarity and worked with different statistical and/or machine learning models.</li>\n<li>Detail oriented, curious, self-motivated</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What you get:</strong> This is an unpaid internship, but clearly, you'll get a ton of on-the-job training (you'd be mentored by our Founder/CEO and Machine Learning Scientist), enjoy flexible working hours, and gain invaluable experience working with an innovative, fast-paced startup.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10-40 hours per week; min. 4 month commitment</p>\n\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> Remote (work anywhere in North America, Europe, or East Asia with internet access)</p>\n\n<p>Join us in disrupting the urban planning and real estate industries - replacing the top-down, opinion-based, expert-driven approach accessible to a few with a data-driven, evidence-based one, accessible to the many - in order to help create more livable, equitable, and sustainable places people deserve.</p>\n\n<p>*When applying, please submit your cover letter (or equivalent note) along with your resume and application. Applicants who do not submit a substantial note/cover letter will not be considered. This is because we want to understand what interests you about State of Place and this position, why you think you'd be a great fit, and what skillsets you have/want to develop.)</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions, shoot them over to <a href=\"mailto:careers@stateofplace.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">careers@stateofplace.co</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Keep on hustling!<br>\nMariela, Founder/CEO State of Place</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.stateofplace.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">State of Place</a> is an AI-driven, urban design data and predictive analytics software. We have developed machine learning models to extract 150+ datapoints about urban design (e.g., sidewalks, trees, benches, outdoor dining) from digital street-level images and open source data. Our proprietary algorithms aggregate this data into the State of Place Index, which measures an area's quality of place, and is broken down into ten sub-indices that measure aspects of urban design empirically tied to people's choices to live, work, or play in some locations over others. Our software allows users to visualize this information graphically and geospatially to identify areas of need. Our forecasting models have tied the Index to social, economic, health, and environmental value, which our AI-models translate into urban design recommendations most likely to lead to desired impacts. And our scenario tool allows users to see how changes to the built environment impact the Index, and also, uniquely, calculate the return on investment of making those changes. No existing tools capture this kind of micro-scale urban design data at scale. Further, most analytics tools only capture data on existing performance; we generate specific, actionable recommendations for how to create more livable, equitable, and sustainable places, while maximizing value across the quadruple bottom line.</p>\n\n<p>Last Spring, in the midst of Covid, we hit a significant technological milestone for the company - we automated our data collection process using visual machine learning, allowing us to extract urban design data from digital stree-level imagery! This has some exciting implications for all aspects of State of Place, from the enhaned solutions we can now offer our customers, to the kinds of projects we can take on, to our revenue model, to our sales strategy, and yes, to our product development and R&amp;D.</p>\n\n<p><strong>State of Place History:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.stateofplace.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">State of Place</a> can be traced back to 2003, when our Founder/CEO, Mariela, accidentally became a data-geek while creating a tool to objectively measure the built environment characteristics that impact the way people feel about their cities. She soon embraced this new-found title, and began a consulting company, - Urban Imprint - realizing that quantifying what made for good urban design - and calculating its tangible value - was actually the key to convincing people to make cities better (and thereby improve people's lives). Fast forward 13 years later, five years after first offering State of Place as a consulting product, we were awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation's Small Business Innovation Research program that funded the MVP (first saleable version) of our software. Today, we have worked with nearly 40 cities and developers in the US, Europe, and Asia, and counting.</p>\n\n<p>Check out our website to learn a bit more about <a href=\"https://www.stateofplace.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">State of Place</a>!</p>"

Join us at Kapwing on our mission to make content creation fast, accessible, and collaborative.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone is a creator. The problem, however, is that today's tools get in the way of expressing our creativity fully. Especially when it comes to video, the gap between an idea and a video is wide enough that it's hard to even start.</p>\n\n<p>Our mission at Kapwing is to make content creation easier and more accessible. Our main product, Kapwing Studio, is an online video editor that is both powerful and easy to use. Millions of creators every month choose Kapwing to tell their story and bring their ideas to life. </p>\n\n<p>Our vision is to build a modern video editing platform that serves as the go-to tool for anyone creating video for Youtube, social media, or work. Being in the browser allows us to turn video editing, a traditionally heavyweight, time consuming workflow, into a joyful, collaborative, and fully-featured experience. We believe that we can use technology to augment the video editing and content creation experience, and we've already started on this path with a wide array of templates, applications of artificial intelligence, and new pipelines for exporting and video processing. </p>\n\n<p>While software is the core of our product, being creative is the core of our work. Every team at Kapwing, from engineering to content to customer success, values trying new things, moving quickly, and helping creators in new ways. With remote work, remote learning, an economic downturn and the rise of social media as a political advocacy channel, video and media entrepreneurship have never been more relevant for the world. Join us on our journey to democratize creative tools and invent the future stack of video creation.</p>\n\n<p>The Internship</p>\n\n<p>We're hiring talented software engineering interns who have experience with web development for Spring or Summer 2022.

This role is a full-time software engineering internship based in San Francisco, reporting to our Engineering Manager. </p>\n\n<p>Ideally, candidates should have experience with our technologies: React, Redux, python, Node, Typescript. Since we're such a small company, interns must be able to build new features independently and be proactive about their own learning. </p>\n\n<p>Interns have the potential to convert to full-time. Full-time offers are considered at the end of the internship. </p>\n\n<p>Requirements</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Currently an undergrad majoring in Computer Science at a 4-year university</li>\n<li>Has contributed to a live website or web application</li>\n<li>Completed at least one production-level internship</li>\n<li>Interested in creative tools, social media, and entrepreneurship</li>\n<li>Experience with MERN stack</li>\n<li>Comfortable with Javascript, React, and python</li>\n<li>Proactive: Identifies problems and solutions</li>\n<li>Must have work authorization in the USA without needing a visa in the next four years.

We've always believed that the best way to learn is to try to put something out there, and then iterate and improve it over time.</p>\n\n<p>Get better everyday: We strive for excellence and we value our craft of writing quality software. At work, we want to challenge ourselves to improve every day.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun: We don't take ourselves too seriously here at Kapwing. We're a product that people use to make all sorts of silly memes.</p>\n\n<p>Inclusion matters: We take pride in our diverse team and a safe and inclusive community at work. We're a female-founded, female-led company. We actively make sure our office (virtual or not) is a safe space for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Speak up: Kapwing is a place where different stories and opinions are valued. We want kind debates, because we know that they will lead us to the best product.</p>\n\n<p>Think original: We love change - and we never want to get stuck in one way of doing things. We embrace what's relevant at any given time.</p>\n\n<p>Benefits<br>\nHealth: Kapwing offers competitive benefits for well-being, including health, vision, and dental insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Time off: We keep reasonable hours, and when it's time to rest, we take that seriously.

We get together online for fun events like a flower arrangement workshop, tie dying, making candles, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Company offsites: When the world is safe again, we're excited to have some fun company offsites. In the past, we've done ski trips and special dinners.</p>\n\n<p>Equipment: We'll give you a new computer and help provide any other office equipment that you need to do your best work.</p>\n\n<p>Hiring process<br>\nOur hiring process is designed for candidates to learn about our company just as much as it is for our team to learn about a candidate. Most candidates will start with a short, behavioral interview, and depending on the team, a sample project or work oriented interviews will be scheduled afterwards. Throughout our interview process, we strive to have empathy, communication, and professionalism. </p>\n\n<p>Our Company<br>\nKapwing is a Series-A stage startup backed by top investors including CRV, Kleiner Perkins, Shasta Ventures, and Village Global. You can learn more about our company and the faces on our team by visiting our careers page, reading our popular blog, or following us on Instagram. </p>\n\n<p>The positions that are currently open at Kapwing are constantly being updated.

That’s where Abridge comes in — our audio-based standalone and integrated solutions record and summarize medical conversations, anywhere care happens.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for research interns to working on exciting NLP challenges using our large annotated proprietary healthcare datasets. You will be able to create/customize your internship research statement and collaborate with our in-house Machine Learning research team. At the end of the internship, you will also have the opportunity to publish your work at top tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, NAACL, and ACL. </p>\n\n<p>The goal of the internship is to advance the state-of-the-art in one or many of the following research areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dialog Understanding </li>\n<li>Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling</li>\n<li>Clinical Natural Language Processing</li>\n<li>Information Extraction</li>\n<li>Machine Learning using Ontologies or Knowledge graphs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Required Qualification:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Must be accepted to or currently enrolled in an MS or Ph.D. program in Computer Science or a related field</li>\n<li>Must have at least one NLP machine learning paper submitted or published </li>\n<li>Experience in utilizing theoretical and empirical research to solve problems</li>\n<li>Ability to communicate complex research ideas in a clear, precise, and actionable manner</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*Research internships are offered year-round with flexible durations</p>\n\n<p>Compensation</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$80,000-$100,000 per year</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Life at Abridge</p>\n\n<p>At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation.

Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and believe that \"you need to taste good things to have good taste.\"</p>\n\n<p>Abridge is an equal opportunity employer.

Include in your cover letter the top 3 specific role(s) you are most interested in, your earliest available start date and latest end date, that you understand a professor will sign off on the program, and any background experience that might be applicable. All Fellows will go through a similar training program while roles will be considerably different depending on prior experience and capabilities.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Dates &amp; Details:</strong>  This fellowship will run continuously (aside from breaks) from early September to end of May at 15-20 hours per week with some flexibility when those hours are done.

New Members set their own goals and then can access capital from a team of supporters to meet needs (like phone service, medications, or proper clothing) and enable action (such as meeting a housing specialist, applying for work, or accessing medical care) towards those goals. Over time, <a href=\"https://www.samaritan.city/pilot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than 50%</a> of Samaritan Members measurably improve access to care, housing, employment, or another goal.</p>\n\n<p>We've practiced this model in Seattle, Oklahoma City, Orange County, with new pilots starting in Denver, Portland, and New York City. For now, we have a mighty team of 8 (frontend, backend, iOS, Android, plus four non-technical).

Millions of baby-boomers are retiring and are facing a tough problem of enjoying their retirement without running out of money. Our digital platform tailors a personalized drawdown strategy for them and assists them to stick by it. By addressing the unique financial circumstances of retirees, PaceIt is poised to become the one-stop solution for all the boomers’ financial needs. </p>\n\n<p>We are four founders with many years of combined experience in the retirement space.  We have been helping individuals accumulate for retirement and have realized that there is no good solution to guide them through withdrawals once those individuals retire. We are leveraging our experience and wide network with retirement plan providers and record keepers to distribute our solution. We have already signed a major 401(k) record keeper as our launch partner. We are now focused on building our core team towards a launch of our MVP in 2021. The company is well funded to achieve that goal. </p>\n\n<p>We’re currently looking for a phenomenal financial engineer with data science capabilities for an unpaid internship starting on June 21, 2021. The internship will allow you to grow and to take part in a multi-disciplinary development effort. Two of the founders are UCLA professors with many years of experience coaching graduate students. </p>\n\n<p>Example of the tasks that you might be asked to complete:<br>\n• Develop Monte Carlo simulations for modeling retirement portfolios.<br>\n• Use machine learning algorithms to improve portfolio modeling. <br>\n• Analyze transaction data and develop algorithms for tracking individuals spending versus their budgets. <br>\n• Develop machine learning algorithm to predict life expectancy and spending patterns of retirees.</p>\n\n<p>Requirements:<br>\n• Previous work in a start-up and/or hi-tech environment is a plus.<br>\n• Experience modeling investment risk and return using Monte Carlo simulations.<br>\n• Experience using statistical computer languages (mostly Python) to manipulate data and draw insights from large data sets.<br>\n• Knowledge of a variety of machine learning techniques (clustering, tree-based techniques, artificial neural networks, etc.) and their real-world advantages/drawbacks. Familiarity with Tensor flow and Keras is a plus. <br>\n• Knowledge of advanced statistical techniques and concepts (regression, properties of distributions, statistical tests and proper usage, etc.) and experience with applications.<br>\n• A drive to learn and master new technologies and techniques.<br>\n• Previous experience with cloud technology (AWS in particular) is an advantage. </p>\n\n<p>This is a rare opportunity to take part in a high-growth venture at an early stage and help build a company with an important mission. If you want to do good and do well, help us create a needed financial solution for the many baby boomers retiring every day.</p>"
