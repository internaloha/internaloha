If you’ve ever wanted to found your own company, or just get experience of scale at this unique stage - this is the role for you.</p>\n\n<p>In this role you will do many things that might be familiar as a Principal, Full-Stack, or another type of Engineer. What’s different about a Founding Engineer is you’re first building a company and a culture. And the customer and product follows that.</p>\n\n<p>What we really want in a Founding Engineer is someone who wants build something great from the ground up. More importantly, someone that wants to share the experience with a great team.</p>\n<h3>Who are we?</h3>\n<p>Our mission is to create calmer organizations. With Pyn, employees get more of the messages they need, and fewer of the ones they don’t. We do this by providing companies with tools for targeted, tailored communications.</p>\n\n<p>Our founders are Jon Williams and Joris Luijke. Jon previously co-founded the technology company Culture Amp. Joris helped scale the culture of Atlassian and Squarespace as their Head of People. Pyn is backed by Accel; an early investor in Facebook, Slack, Dropbox, and many more great companies.</p>\n\n<p>Pyn originates from Sydney, Australia. However, we have employees and customers across the globe. While we work remotely, we still love to get together if and when we can. Ideally our employees have good overlap with the Australian Eastern or Pacific time zones.</p>\n<h3>Your impact</h3>\n<p>As Founding Engineer, you will champion new features all the way from ideation to implementation. As this champion, you will be talking to our customers every day.</p>\n\n<p>At Pyn, you will work across the whole organization. Everything from building our Web Application, to helping customers, mentoring engineers, and building our culture.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of nuts and bolts: The Pyn Application uses React and GraphQL. The codebase is largely TypeScript and deployed on a serverless AWS infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>We expect this architecture to evolve considerably as we grow. As a Founding Engineer, you’ll be responsible for technical direction in this evolution. You will be a key part of Pyn shipping fast, scaling up, and staying secure for our customers.</p>\n<h3>What we offer</h3>\n<p>At Pyn you will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>work directly with the Founders on product direction, strategy, and execution.</li>\n<li>be part of forming our values, and a leader for the culture we are building.</li>\n<li>work with Jon and the team on the software architecture and strategy.</li>\n<li>have regular, direct contact with our customers to understand their needs.</li>\n<li>use your experience to mentor and grow other team members.</li>\n<li>* be in a dynamic remote-work environment, with flexible hours and parental leave.</li>\n<li>exercise your curiosity and grow technical, product, and people skills.</li>\n<li>continue to ship code daily (if not hourly!) to get value to customers hands as soon as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>… change the way companies communicate with their employees.</p>\n<h3>What you bring</h3>\n<p>We recognize that people and careers are a unique journey. Recognizing this, we do not have strict skill and education requirements. Whilst there will always be specific skills we see as useful, we value the whole of what you can bring to Pyn.</p>\n\n<p>As one of our most senior hires, we want to draw upon your experience. As such it’s likely you’re a number of years into your career (or careers!). Whilst a traditional engineering background will suit this, so will many others.</p>\n\n<p>We’re striving to create a diverse environment and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. If you’re curious and passionate about improving employee communications, then we’d love to hear from you.</p>"

We’re turning passive bystanders into active participants in every conversation.</p>\n\n<p>We’re shaking up the social media industry by showing the world what the people really think and not just painting a one-sided narrative. It’s an audacious undertaking, considering we’re going up against some of the biggest and most recognizable companies in the tech world, but we know we have the right team for the task. </p>\n\n<p>Our marketing team is a group of ambitious creatives and connectors who bring unique perspectives to our brand marketing campaigns. Our founders are lifetime entrepreneurs who have always questioned the status quo and worked to improve it exponentially., Our engineering team has a diverse background of experience in startups and established technology companies. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to find out more about what we’re working on at Cast head over to our blog, or download the app and get casting! <a href=\"http://joincast.co/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://joincast.co/download</a> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Cast Culture</strong><br>\nWe are a remote-first startup and plan to remain so for the foreseeable future. We have operated this way since our inception and have found great success in this process.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, we still think the best results come from collaboration and working closely with each other. We have a small office in an old factory building in the west end of Toronto that we use when we need to get together for strategy meetings, whiteboard sessions, or company get-togethers. Deep down we still miss the days of working from the office.</p>\n\n<p>We’re still in the early stages of creating Cast so you’ll be working closely with the founding team and your ideas and opinion will have a big impact on inputs and outputs. For that reason we look for individuals who bring unique and honest perspectives to the conversation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About you</strong><br>\nWe're looking for a Social Media Maverick who gets excited about being the voice and persona of a company on social media.

From pioneering work at Google, SpaceX, and Uber, we bring expertise in massively parallel cloud computing, high-scale real-time analytics, and high-reliability computing.</p>\n\n<p>We work on building software for the grid. The challenges faced by grid operators in an evolving energy landscape are unique. The existing grid is one of humanity’s largest machines, and keeping it running safely and smoothly is critical to modern life. But as it becomes smarter, more connected, and more dynamic, we can draw lessons from other industries about how to manage the challenges of scale and reliability for an effective energy transition.</p>\n\n<p>We founded Camus Energy to lend our software engineering skills to address climate change. We are committed to accelerating the adoption of renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions from the energy grid.</p>\n\n<p>We believe that we can combine our desire to impact the world with our technical expertise to bring about positive change. And we are going to have fun doing it.</p>\n<h3>The Role</h3>\n<p>Camus needs great engineers. You will contribute in all aspects of product and infrastructure development, including: requirements gathering, software development, testing, documentation, training, implementation, and ongoing support and maintenance. We are creating the grid management systems of the future using the full set of modern, scalable tools and techniques. So, knowing how to work with existing open source software and services can have as important a role as new software development.</p>\n\n<p>Camus is a fast moving environment. You will be tasked with solving various problems over time. You will work in an agile development environment, moving quickly from customer requirements to working systems and applications.</p>\n\n<p>Communication is paramount at Camus.

Keep reading...</p>\n\n<p>Goobr is a social media platform exclusively for pets. We're going to disrupt the massive but boring pet industry by not only making pet ownership significantly easier, but also more fun for the next generation of pet owners. I have a killer product ready to go and am looking to bring this person on prior to launch so we can fix bugs and scale internally. Priot to Goobr, I founded and scaled one of the fastest growing plant-based nutrition companies in the country and partially exited to General Mills. </p>\n\n<p>I'm looking for someone that's hungry and has something to prove. As the first employee and founding engineer, you shouldn't just be an executor that takes directions. Ideally, you're a builder, a creative, and someone who understands that without taking risks, there is no reward. In the early days, you'll be deep in the trenches by not only doing all of the engineering work, but also playing a big role on the product side, and anything else that could potentially add value to the business. As the company grows, it will be your job to build and manage the entire engineering/tech team from scratch.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm a big believer that a company's team is their product and without the right one in place, you will fail. If it sounds like it might be a fit, please reach out so I can give you more details! </p>\n\n<p>Thanks,<br>\n-Daniel Katz, but just call me D.</p>"

While a very small, fast-paced team we don’t take ourselves too seriously and have a lot of fun working together. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Application Process:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>This is an unpaid academic internship in partnership with your university. If selected for our year long cohort, you will have a professor sign our internship agreement (some students have elected to also get credit through their university but this is not required). Include in your cover letter the top 3 specific role(s) you are most interested in, your earliest available start date and latest end date, that you understand a professor will sign off on the program, and any background experience that might be applicable.

This is an <strong>unpaid</strong> internship opportunity, that will require <strong>5 - 10 hours/week</strong> commitment. Visa sponsorship is not available.*</p>\n\n<p><strong>OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU!</strong></p>\n\n<p>You will have the opportunity to work with a team on your campus and InstaHub's team to plan, communicate, secure funding (e.g. crowdfund, sustainability grants), deploy, and evaluate the project (detailed below) for your own school. We have domain expertise and proven experience to help your team achieve similar successes. Our data scientists' insights will teach your team about the specificity of the energy-saving opportunities regardless of your prior knowledge. All local news and public relation opportunities that will come up will focus on YOUR team's effort for leading YOUR school's climate action commitment. Plus, this will also be a great resume builder.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WHAT WILL YOU LEARN?</strong></p>\n\n<p>-How to digest your school's climate action plan goals.<br>\n-How to conduct an intermediate-level building energy audit.<br>\n-How to successfully fundraise (e.g. crowdfunding, grants, etc.)<br>\n-Soft Skills (e.g. time management, teamwork, public speaking, problem-solving, critical thinking, etc.)<br>\n-Business skills (e.g. project management, stakeholder analysis, marketing/PR, impact modelling, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Apply: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchAVe9PubZ1tcdheBuuf6Y5IjcxpqZiVvSKw5hoSTMmXtzHA/viewform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Get Involved Now: Google Form Submission</strong></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>VISION</strong></p>\n\n<p>Eliminate global energy waste.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MISSION</strong></p>\n\n<p>Use artificial intelligence to save money and energy without replacing expensive building equipment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>INTRO</strong></p>\n\n<p>InstaHub is a sustainability-tech startup with a triple bottom line business model started by students at the University of Pennsylvania in 2016 helping campuses across the U.S. build climate change awareness, sharing free energy-saving tips, and using accessible artificial intelligence to combat persistent and invisible energy waste across buildings. InstaHub is teaching students how to identify/calculate/address energy waste on campuses across the country through our Sustainability Campus Ambassador Program. </p>\n\n<p><strong>FOCUS</strong></p>\n\n<p>Why focus on buildings? Building accounts for 40% of global carbon emissions and 97% of US buildings consistently bleed out unused energy. $1+ trillion of energy in the US alone is wasted every 5 years. School buildings are mostly owner operated with an immense amount of energy waste while students are eager to learn how to make a sustainable impact and support campus Climate Action Plans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PROBLEM</strong><br>\nWe believe existing data loggers and automation solutions are overpriced, obscure, difficult to install, and require too many steps to extract useful insights/recommendations causing limited adoption for the facility management industry. Saving energy should not cost an arm and a leg nor should it be rocket science!</p>\n\n<p><em>(real anonymous energy saving projects requiring 20-40 years payback period)</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>PILOT OBJECTIVE</strong><br>\nWe have deployed and will continue to deploy \"instant plug-n-play\" 5-in-1 sensor data loggers, \"Instaloggers\", into buildings collecting 5 sensor data points per room about its operational &amp; environmental conditions (e.g. space utilization, temperature, humidity, pressure, light, etc.) over time. Each building has multiple floors, rooms, room types, users, schedules, and operational uses. Let’s make AI more turnkey to save energy!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Our objectives are:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1) Provide an instant plug-n-play data collection of occupancy + environmental sensors (Phase 1)<br>\n2) Provide easy to read visualization and analysis of the data (Phase 2)<br>\n3) Automate energy waste pattern detection and segmentation (Phase 3)<br>\n4) Automate the prioritization of actionable insights/recommendations (Phase 4) </p>\n\n<p><strong>OUTCOME:</strong> To ultimately help building/energy managers update BMS/RTU/VAV Box/Thermostatic setback schedules and/or lighting schedules using AI-driven and occupancy-based pattern recognition, saving tens of thousands of dollars (achieving 1-3 year payback periods). </p>\n\n<p><strong>IMPACT</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can help your school save $2,000 - $20,000/year from energy waste per building (50-150k kwh/year savings or 150,000 pounds of CO2 Emissions.) We will teach you how to calculate the impact leveraging tools like EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator.

We are seeking a bright, dynamic, and creative MBA candidate with a true passion for startups and venture investing to assist in growing our online brand presence.</p>\n\n<p>We will be accepting applicants until the end of September, aiming for a start date of October 1st.</p>\n<h3>About Us</h3>\n<p>RTV is the venture arm of Recharge Capital, a single family office headquartered in Hong Kong with operations in Beijing, New York and Singapore. RTV invests across sectors as varied as fintech, consumer tech, healthtech, and proptech, with a strong emerging markets and consumer angle. The fund also invests across stages, from pre-seed to Series A, and will follow on champion winners. We at RTV act not only as investors, but as partners, bringing our significant talent and operational capabilities to help our portfolio companies grow. </p>\n\n<p>Serving as our Platform and Marketing Intern means stepping into an exciting role at an opportune time. RTV I is in its first investment period, and you would play an integral part in scaling our firm’s marketing and community-building efforts. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Learning Opportunities</strong></p>\n\n<p>You are granted the chance to be at the ground floor of a venture capital firm, and bear witness to our fund scaling upward. You will additionally get to learn the ins and outs of VC by sitting in on our team's regular deal-flow meetings, observing how we connect with founders, and working closely with our analysts on examining global industry trends.</p>\n\n<p>Responsibilities </p>\n\n<p>You will be responsible for recommending and driving key content marketing strategies, partnerships, and community development decisions for our firm. Above all, this role will provide you with the opportunity to gain unique exposure to the fast-paced and exhilarating world of venture capital.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>\n\n<p>Your mission is to formulate and execute a clear and effective social media strategy to increase Recharge Capital's reach.

You will also help oversee Recharge's media relations with both key opinion leaders and traditional media outlets. You will use your creativity to make and disseminate targeted media that effectively elevates Recharge’s brand name.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Community</strong></p>\n\n<p>You will maintain ongoing communication with founders, partner VCs, and sponsors. Another part of your role is establishing long-standing relationships with founders not yet affiliated with Recharge, collaborating with them to drive engagement both online (AMAs, forums, content and distribution partnerships) and offline (working lunches, networking opportunities, industry-focused dinners, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>We are a small team (two Partners, one Principal, four analysts, and the incoming MBA Intern), working in four-week sprints over a quarterly planning cycle that necessitates extreme focus. You will fully own the creation and execution of our platform strategy, and take our community to new heights.</p>\n\n<p>*<em>Ideally, You: *</em></p>\n\n<p>• Enjoy distilling salient information down to succinct verbal and written communication  </p>\n\n<p>• Possess strong communication skills and an ability to quickly brush up on any subject matter </p>\n\n<p>• Are a creative problem solver and outside-the-box thinker who maintains a great attitude and a willingness to get their hands dirty </p>\n\n<p>• Have been a life-long learner, a voracious reader that naturally explores new ideas and technologies</p>\n\n<p>• Are a natural networker with strong social skills, a self-starter with an ability to own their projects </p>\n\n<p>• Collaborate well across groups, easily build relationships within an organization, demonstrate excellent management skills</p>\n\n<p>• Can work under pressure in a dynamic environment </p>\n\n<p>*<em>Knowledge &amp; Experience *</em></p>\n\n<p>• Bachelor’s Degree minimum </p>\n\n<p>• 3-5 years of work experience, preferably at a PR/ marketing agency, venture capital, or technology firm</p>\n\n<p>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. We’re eager to invigorate Recharge with different perspectives and worldviews, and diversify our team through this opportunity.</p>"
