        "description": "<p>Have you ever wanted to know what it is like to build a startup from the ground up? If you’ve ever wanted to found your own company, or just get experience of scale at this unique stage - this is the role for you.</p>\n\n<p>In this role you will do many things that might be familiar as a Principal, Full-Stack, or another type of Engineer. What’s different about a Founding Engineer is you’re first building a company and a culture. And the customer and product follows that.</p>\n\n<p>What we really want in a Founding Engineer is someone who wants build something great from the ground up. More importantly, someone that wants to share the experience with a great team.</p>\n<h3>Who are we?</h3>\n<p>Our mission is to create calmer organizations. With Pyn, employees get more of the messages they need, and fewer of the ones they don’t. We do this by providing companies with tools for targeted, tailored communications.</p>\n\n<p>Our founders are Jon Williams and Joris Luijke. Jon previously co-founded the technology company Culture Amp. Joris helped scale the culture of Atlassian and Squarespace as their Head of People. Pyn is backed by Accel; an early investor in Facebook, Slack, Dropbox, and many more great companies.</p>\n\n<p>Pyn originates from Sydney, Australia. However, we have employees and customers across the globe. While we work remotely, we still love to get together if and when we can. Ideally our employees have good overlap with the Australian Eastern or Pacific time zones.</p>\n<h3>Your impact</h3>\n<p>As Founding Engineer, you will champion new features all the way from ideation to implementation. As this champion, you will be talking to our customers every day.</p>\n\n<p>At Pyn, you will work across the whole organization. Everything from building our Web Application, to helping customers, mentoring engineers, and building our culture.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of nuts and bolts: The Pyn Application uses React and GraphQL. The codebase is largely TypeScript and deployed on a serverless AWS infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>We expect this architecture to evolve considerably as we grow. As a Founding Engineer, you’ll be responsible for technical direction in this evolution. You will be a key part of Pyn shipping fast, scaling up, and staying secure for our customers.</p>\n<h3>What we offer</h3>\n<p>At Pyn you will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>work directly with the Founders on product direction, strategy, and execution.</li>\n<li>be part of forming our values, and a leader for the culture we are building.</li>\n<li>work with Jon and the team on the software architecture and strategy.</li>\n<li>have regular, direct contact with our customers to understand their needs.</li>\n<li>use your experience to mentor and grow other team members.</li>\n<li>* be in a dynamic remote-work environment, with flexible hours and parental leave.</li>\n<li>exercise your curiosity and grow technical, product, and people skills.</li>\n<li>continue to ship code daily (if not hourly!) to get value to customers hands as soon as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>… change the way companies communicate with their employees.</p>\n<h3>What you bring</h3>\n<p>We recognize that people and careers are a unique journey. Recognizing this, we do not have strict skill and education requirements. Whilst there will always be specific skills we see as useful, we value the whole of what you can bring to Pyn.</p>\n\n<p>As one of our most senior hires, we want to draw upon your experience. As such it’s likely you’re a number of years into your career (or careers!). Whilst a traditional engineering background will suit this, so will many others.</p>\n\n<p>We’re striving to create a diverse environment and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. If you’re curious and passionate about improving employee communications, then we’d love to hear from you.</p>"

Spend time at construction sites where our robot is printing layouts to evaluate your contributions in action.</p>\n\n<p>Our engineering team designs and builds our mobile printing robot, the software that runs the robot, the user interfaces that help workers operate the robot, and customer-facing portals that are driving fundamental change in the process of constructing buildings. As an intern, you could work on any area of our product, depending on your background:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Software Engineering (C++, Python, iOS, React / full-stack web development)</li>\n<li>Robotics</li>\n<li>Control Systems</li>\n<li>Data Science</li>\n<li>Mechanical Engineering</li>\n<li>Electrical Engineering</li>\n<li>Mechatronics</li>\n<li>UX design</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you span more than one of these areas, even better! We love generalists who are always ready to spring from one set of skills to another.</p>\n\n<p>We like to give interns projects that combine getting a specific piece of work done with an open question to explore for further refinement. For example, you might integrate a new sensor on the robot, then collect data to evaluate its performance. Or, you might implement a specific feature in the operator interface, then head out to a construction site to see how useful it is to operators. You’ll experience this fundamental cycle of product development for yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Working at Dusty</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are a culture of do-ers who respect each others’ strengths, and work together to accomplish the impossible. We value open-mindedness, technical depth, passion for what we’re building, an itch to build something with your own two hands. We celebrate people who create their own narratives rather than living someone else’s.</p>\n\n<p>We also provide mentorship in all areas of engineering to help you do your best work. In addition to day-to-day guidance from experienced engineers, we host weekly discussions on engineering topics. We reimburse attendance fees for technology conferences on robotics and other fields. And we offer support in accessing whatever resources you find helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Spending your internship in Silicon Valley also offers tremendous opportunities to learn from the concentration of innovative people who work and live here! You’ll find conferences, meetups, presentations and informal get-togethers related to pretty much any area of technology or the tech industry that interests you. Dusty is located in the heart of it all.</p>"

Our mission is to provide every human on Earth with instant access to vital medical supplies. Join Zipline and help us make this a reality for billions of people.</p>\n<h3><strong>About You and The Role</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Note: This is a paid opportunity.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Do you love tinkering with mechanical and electrical devices and watching your code come to life? Does writing safety-critical low-level software intrigue you? Do you see your projects through from start to finish, regardless of what you’re working on? </p>\n\n<p>Zipline is looking for interns to join our Embedded Systems team to create and improve upon a reliable software platform for our autonomous aircraft and ground systems. As a member of the team, you will go deep in your area of ownership, becoming an expert in the problem domain, defining requirements for systems, rapidly developing creative and simple solutions, and proving with testing and data that the system meets the rigors and edge-cases of real-world deployment. Embedded Systems engineers at Zipline also contribute beyond their field--reviewing schematics, building user interfaces, designing hardware in the loop test systems, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Zipline designs and operates the world’s largest drone delivery service providing access to critical medical supplies. Leading the way in drone delivery often means exceeding the capabilities of what’s available off the shelf, and as a result we are engineering the majority of our system in-house. Doubling down on the reliability of our systems and inventing new robots is a critical path to delivering to our next billion customers--people whose lives will be meaningfully affected by smarter, more equitable access!</p>\n<h3><strong>What You'll Do</strong></h3>\n<p>Embedded interns can own a variety of big problems integral to our system! Examples of previous projects included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Building a high data rate voltage and current telemetry system that runs continuously in our RTOS using ADCs, I2C devices and GPIO interrupts. Testing this feature rigorously, deploying it to production globally, building data analysis tools to verify that the feature is working properly, and using this data to root-cause tricky failures to improve the reliability of our systems.</li>\n<li>Rapidly iterating on the concept of a new perception system, integrating compute modules and sensor prototypes to fly a proof of concept ASAP and de-risk key aspects of the approach.</li>\n<li>Building a system to multiplex batteries between chargers, reducing charging times and operator fatigue. Owning the entire feature development process from the design and user interface, through implementation, testing, deployment, and data monitoring, continuously soliciting feedback from engineers and operators throughout the whole process.</li>\n<li>Working with the Guidance, Navigation and Controls team to integrate a new plant model into our Hardware-in-the-Loop simulator, unlocking new testing capabilities across our entire software team.</li>\n<li>Finding ways to make the codebase better for other engineers through every feature built, for example removing tech debt, adding debugging or logging tools, increasing test coverage, improving toolchains or build times, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What You'll Bring</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You've designed and built electromechanical systems and robots outside the classroom. Previous interns have built submarines, solar cars in the Australian outback, electric boats, rockets, etc.</li>\n<li>You’re comfortable working in C, C++, Python, and/or Rust, and have developed software for a real time operating system or embedded linux.</li>\n<li>You set a high standard for your software -- your code is efficient, easy-to-ready, well-tested, and has friendly APIs. </li>\n<li>You’re familiar with basic electrical engineering concepts, such as reading schematics, and debugging with a multimeter, scope, and logic analyzer.</li>\n<li>You can work independently--taking ownership of projects with ambiguous requirements--as well as collaboratively with a diverse team.</li>\n<li>Additional interdisciplinary engineering skills are a plus, such as control of dynamic systems, PCB design/CAD, or backend infrastructure experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Internship Timing</strong></h3>\n<p>Zipline is looking for embedded systems interns throughout 2022. The minimum internship duration is 10 weeks. Longer internships/co-ops are encouraged but not required. It is common for interns on our embedded systems to complete an internship of 4-6 months. A longer tenure multiplies impact, you’ll have learned a ton at Zipline in your first several weeks and be able to tackle projects of significant complexity and impact as your internship continues.</p>\n<h3><strong>What Else You Need To Know</strong></h3>\n<p>Zipline is an equal opportunity employer and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws or our own sensibilities.
