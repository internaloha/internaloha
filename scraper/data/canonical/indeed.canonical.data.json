Our team members provide their expertise to ensure customer success through the design, development and execution of innovative and comprehensive test, verification and validation strategies, processes, tools and techniques. SI&amp;T employees are involved in all aspects of test including: design-for-test, integration, subsystem, and component level testing through Customer sell-off of our most sophisticated systems and technologies.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Systems Engineering Intern</b><br>\n<br>\nWhat is Systems Engineering? What does a Systems Engineer do? Systems Engineering contributes to programs throughout the entire product development lifecycle, from inception through development, sell-off, deployment, and operations and maintenance in the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nSystems Engineers work within an interdisciplinary process that ensures that the customer's needs are satisfied throughout a system's entire life cycle. This process is comprised of the following seven tasks:<br>\n<br>\n1. State the problem. Stating the problem is the most important systems engineering task. It entails identifying customers, understanding customer needs, establishing the need for change, discovering requirements, and defining system functions.<br>\n<br>\n2. Investigate alternatives. Alternatives are investigated and evaluated based on performance, cost, and risk.<br>\n<br>\n3. Model the system. Running models clarifies requirements, reveals bottlenecks and fragmented activities, reduces cost and exposes duplication of efforts.<br>\n<br>\n4. Integrate. Integration means designing interfaces and bringing system elements together so they work as a whole. This requires extensive communication and coordination.<br>\n<br>\n5. Launch the system. Launching the system means running the system and producing outputs to verify that the system does what it was intended to do.<br>\n<br>\n6. Assess performance. Performance is assessed using figures of merit, technical performance measures, and metrics - measurement is the key. If you cannot measure it, you cannot control it. If you cannot control it, you cannot improve it.<br>\n<br>\n7. Re-evaluation. Re-evaluation should be a continual and iterative process with many parallel loops.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Job Description\n</b><br>\n<br>\nOpportunities for Interns require individuals to use engineering, math, and teamwork skills to perform various engineering activities, such as requirements development, system test and validation planning and execution, modeling and simulation, data analysis, flight test analysis, and overall systems integration.

Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities - we're just getting started.\n<br>\nFacebook Reality Labs (FRL) focuses on delivering Facebook's vision through Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). The compute performance and power efficiency requirements of Virtual and Augmented Reality require custom silicon. Facebook Silicon team is driving the state of the art forward with breakthrough work in computer vision, machine learning, mixed reality, graphics, displays, sensors, and new ways to map the human body. Our chips will enable AR and VR devices where our real and virtual world will mix and match throughout the day. We believe the only way to achieve our goals is to look at the entire stack, from transistor, through architecture, to firmware and algorithms.
