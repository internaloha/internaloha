In addition from the support from your team you’ll be assigned a Mentor outside of your department who will guide you and mentor you throughout the summer</li>\n<li>End of summer presentation.

We have a wonderful team of kind-hearted, talented engineers that love to collaborate, teach each other new tricks, and build products that exceed our customers’ expectations.</p>\n<p>\nOur technology stack is largely JVM languages (Java, Kotlin) with some C#/.NET on the backend, and TypeScript / React (migrating from AngularJS) on the frontend.

Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices. Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.</p>\n<p><b><i>\nWhat else you should know:</i></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re a publicly-traded company (TREE).</li>\n<li>We’ve welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.</li>\n<li>We’ve built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.</li>\n<li>We still make funny commercials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>CULTURE</b></p>\n<p>\nWe’re a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We’re collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you’ll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, <i>do</i> wear clothes to work!), and we’re pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, “Get Stuff Done”).</p>\n<p>\nCome work with us!</p>\n<p><i>\nLendingTree is the kind of company that not only promotes diversity and inclusion; we thrive because of these values.
