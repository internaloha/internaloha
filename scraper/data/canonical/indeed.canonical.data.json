The enterprise dataset is intended to integrate all of the NPS cultural resource inventory databases, allowing NPS park resource managers, regional staff and national program managers to better understand and plan for cultural resources within NPS holdings. Unrestricted portions of the data are also made available to the public through internet applications, internet data viewers and government-wide spatial data search portals.<br>\n<br>\nSpatial data created in this project will delineate cultural resources described in the State, Tribal, Local, Plans and Grants database (STLPG) as well as the Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record/Historic American Landscape Survey inventory (HABS/HAER/HALS) in the NPS spatial data transfer standard format to facilitate inclusion in the NPS cultural resource enterprise GIS dataset. Additionally, this spatial data will cross-reference with other NPS databases already in the enterprise (Cultural Landscapes Inventory, List of Classified Structures and National Register of Historic Places) which may reference the same resources, but contain different descriptive or condition information. The resulting product will allow NPS resource managers, planners and program managers to visualize integrated cultural resource inventory data for the first time, improve the quality of existing spatial data and provide the tools to better steward the resources.<br>\n<br>\nData created specifically for HABS/HAER/HALS will be further distributed to the general public as an Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDA) in the FGDC Cultural Resource theme. Together with the existing National Register of Historic Places data set, also an NGDA in the FGDC Cultural Resource theme, these data sets will become the authoritative national source for cultural resource information, aiding in compliance with regulations under the National Historic Preservation Act and specifically related to disaster and climate change response.<br>\n<br>\nThis position will be responsible for completing the data creation and input into a Geographic Information System (GIS). The intern will be working with the records of the State, Tribal, Local, Plans and Grants database (STLPG) as well as the Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record/Historic American Landscapes Survey database (HABS/HAER/HALS). Spatial coordinates will be gathered from the inventory where possible and then transferred to the GIS. Where no coordinates exist, new spatial data will be generated. The intern will also complete the metadata for each record in the GIS, to comply with the NPS cultural resource spatial data transfer standards. Finally, the interns will incorporate the spatial data created into the cultural resource enterprise data set and create links between the spatial data and the STLPG and HABS/HAER/HALS databases.</div>\n<ul><li>Location Description\n<div>The position will be located in Washington, DC where the database managers are co-located, but the inventories used in the project are national in scope.
