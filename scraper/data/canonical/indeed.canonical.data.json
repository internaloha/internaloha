Cargill Digital Labs (CDL) strives to help prepare Cargill for a digital future. The vision of this future includes a thriving digital culture, continually launching of new digital business initiatives, and that Cargill will be a digital thought leader in the food and agriculture industries.\n<br><br>\nIn May 2019, Cargill established a research site within UIUC’s Research Park to further this mission. In its first iteration, we leverage the site to host digital research projects, such as software, hardware and engineering prototypes that are staffed by student interns from the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign. As we gain learnings from the experience, we will grow and mature our development capabilities within the park to best suit Cargill’s evolving digital journey.\n<br>Job Purpose and Impact\n<br><br>\nWhy intern with us?\n<br><br>\nProfessional Experience - Gain professional experience as a software engineer working in a cross-functional team. Learn best practices from industry professionals. Understand what it is like to work within an agile software product team.\n<br>Build Prototypes - Work on fast-paced, digital prototype projects. Ship a functioning prototype over the course of weeks. Collaborate with clients to test prototypes and gain real-world insights.\n<br>Cross-Functional - Gain exposure speaking with and presenting to a variety of stakeholders across business, engineering, design and product functions. Work in tandem with a UX UI designer on understanding the user’s journey, wireframes and user interface designs.\n<br>Startup Culture – Wonder what it would be like to work within a product team at a software company? Or how about getting a software MVP off the ground? Your project for the semester will include building a prototype from scratch or exploring future features of an existing app. You’re paired with other software engineers and UX UI designers to go from requirements gathering, planning, design, architecture, dev, quality assurance to testing with real users over the course of a semester.\n<br>Use Cases That Matter – Work on real innovation initiatives that serve a variety of clients at Cargill ranging from animal nutrition, animal supply chain, food industry, learning and development, to trading and analytics. Apply your talents on digital initiatives that transform global food systems.\n<br><br>\nHaving the Right Mindset\n<br><br>\nWhile engineering fundamentals are a must, we look for students that enjoy startup culture and are adept at working collaboratively within a team. Comfort with ambiguity is a must. Empathy for other functions and the end user is critical. Lean mindset to build the smallest thing possible is a key to success. We don’t expect you to be an expert on the entire stack, but we do look for students that are hungry to learn new things. Expand your skills in a high growth ag tech industry just a few blocks off campus.

Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.<br>\n<br>\nDue regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.<br>\n<br>\nThe paramount consideration in the appointment, transfer, or promotion of staff shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. By accepting an offer of appointment, United Nations staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and assignment by him or her to any activities or offices of the United Nations in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (c). In this context, all internationally recruited staff members shall be required to move periodically to discharge new functions within or across duty stations under conditions established by the Secretary-General.\n<br>\n<br>\nApplicants are urged to follow carefully all instructions available in the online recruitment platform, inspira. For more detailed guidance, applicants may refer to the Manual for the Applicant, which can be accessed by clicking on “Manuals” hyper-link on the upper right side of the inspira account-holder homepage.<br>\n<br>\nThe evaluation of applicants will be conducted on the basis of the information submitted in the application according to the evaluation criteria of the job opening and the applicable internal legislations of the United Nations including the Charter of the United Nations, resolutions of the General Assembly, the Staff Regulations and Rules, administrative issuances and guidelines. Applicants must provide complete and accurate information pertaining to their personal profile and qualifications according to the instructions provided in inspira to be considered for the current job opening. No amendment, addition, deletion, revision or modification shall be made to applications that have been submitted. Candidates under serious consideration for selection will be subject to reference checks to verify the information provided in the application.<br>\n<br>\nJob openings advertised on the Careers Portal will be removed at 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on the deadline date.\n</p>No Fee\n<p>THE UNITED NATIONS DOES NOT CHARGE A FEE AT ANY STAGE OF THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS (APPLICATION, INTERVIEW MEETING, PROCESSING, OR TRAINING). THE UNITED NATIONS DOES NOT CONCERN ITSELF WITH INFORMATION ON APPLICANTS’ BANK ACCOUNTS.</p></div><p></p>"

OFE is the first local government initiative in the country with the mission to educate, empower, and protect New Yorkers and neighborhoods with low incomes so they can build assets and make the most of their financial resources.
