We support discovery science experiments in Illinois and South Dakota and at locations around the world, including Canada, mountaintops in Arizona and Chile, and the South Pole.</p>\n<p>The Computing Division seeks current graduate students majoring in computer science and related fields who are interested in working at a national science research laboratory. While providing the opportunity to gain experience understanding of Fermilab computing for High Energy Physics, the intern assists with laboratory R&amp;D efforts to explore and enable the use of cutting-edge tools and technology for the benefit of the science community The selected candidate(s) will be assigned to one of the below projects.</p>\n<p><b>Enhanced I/O systems for particle physics experiments</b></p>\n<p>Current and next-generation neutrino and precision muon experiments at Fermilab will collect data at the multi-petabyte level and will require computing resources of a wide variety of types at sites distributed around the world. One of the major challenges to these experiments is data movement and management. With such a large array of possible resource types and storage elements it can be extremely difficult for end users to consistently make optimal choices when performing analysis, and what works on one set of resources may not work on another. The candidate will work with offline production and data management personnel to design and build enhanced I/O services for use by experiments within jobs. These services would perform a number of functions such as automatically choosing the optimal location from which to read inputs for a given job (or even steering jobs to known data locations) and choosing the most efficient location for initial job output storage. These services would interface with existing and planned data management and replication systems to allow for optimal data movement in and out of jobs with minimal user intervention.</p>\n<p><b>Big Data analysis of data transfers in multi petabyte distributed storage system</b></p>\n<p>Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) develops and operates a tiered data storage system that stores, manages and delivers to scientists hundreds of petabytes of scientific data. A tape backend and a distributed disk cache frontend forms the two tiers of the system. The disk cache frontend provides fast access to a subset of the data but is limited by the aggregate cache size while the tape backend provides large scale \"cold data” storage with the bandwidth limited by the number of tape drives serving the system. The disk cache, tape drives and available network bandwidth represent a set of limited resources requiring clever data flow management to achieve maximum data delivery efficiency. Going forward the amount of data generated by physics experiments is expected to increase dramatically while resource levels are expected to grow at a much slower pace. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the usage of the system develops over time in order to be able to find and eventually eliminate inefficiencies or pathological behavior. Each data transfer in the system is recorded resulting in data samples of about 10 GB/month. We are looking forward to performing Big Data analysis on these data with the goal of identifying patterns that could lead to improvements in the configuration of the system based on previous usage patterns. Ultimately we would like to develop ML-based tools that will aid in implementing ongoing self-correcting behavior in the storage system. We are looking for an intern position to help with this interesting research and development task. The candidate will work with the storage developers and operators to create a system to analyze the transfer data using Apache Spark and utilizing Python 3 and Jupyter Notebo.</p>\n<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Enrollment in a U.S. college or university in Computer Science or related graduate program</li>\n<li>3.0 grade point average or above on a 4.0 scale</li>\n<li>Eligible to work in the United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Application Requirements:\n</b></p><ul><li>Online application</li>\n<li>Proficiency questionnaire</li>\n<li>Unofficial transcript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Deliverables:\n</b></p><ul><li>Oral presentation</li>\n<li>Poster presentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Internship Details:</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>Salary: </b>$825 - $875 weekly depending on the academic year</li>\n<li><b>Remote:</b> This internship will be 100% remote.

Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics: customers are primarily businesses, have recurring revenue models, have specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high margins, and have similar selling systems.<br>\n</div><div><br>\nFLEETCOR enjoys global recognition including:\n</div><ul><li>Forbes Global Growth Champion – FLEETCOR is one of the 250 fastest growing companies in the world as determined by Forbes and Statista</li></ul><ul>\n<li>Forbes World’s Most Innovative Companies – FLEETCOR has made this prestigious list of leading innovative companies 4 years in a row!</li></ul><ul>\n<li>Fortune 1000 Company – FLEETCOR was one of the largest movers in the new rankings of the largest companies in America, ranking #872</li></ul><ul>\n<li>S&amp;P 500 – In 2018, FLEETCOR joined the S&amp;P stock index comprised of the 500 leading US stocks based on market cap (company value)\n</li></ul><div><b>Our Vision</b><b><br>\n</b></div><div>Despite many advances in our industry, the majority of business payments are still made with outdated and inferior payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a business world where every purchase is controlled, every payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with more time for what matters most: activities that grow their businesses.<br>\n</div><div><b>Our Mission</b><b><br>\n</b></div><div>FLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR.<b><br>\n</b></div><div><br>\n<b>Our Strategy</b><b><br>\n</b></div><div>FLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple three-prong strategy for growing our business:\n</div><ul><li>More Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions.</li></ul><ul>\n<li>More Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example:</li></ul><ul>\n<ul><li>Our Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job.</li></ul></ul><ul><ul>\n<li>Our Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food.</li></ul></ul><div><div>\nFor our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base.</div></div>\n<ul><li>More Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships.\n</li></ul><div><b>Our Commitment to Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, Belonging</b></div><div><b><br>\n</b></div><div>Together we can foster true belonging. We know different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds lead to better innovation and results. We are therefore committed to building and nurturing a culture of diversity, inclusion, and belonging by:\n</div><ul><li>Welcoming people of different backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations;</li></ul><ul>\n<li>Empowering our people to share their experiences and ideas through open forums and individual conversations; and</li></ul><ul>\n<li>Valuing each person’s unique perspectives and individual contributions.\n</li></ul><div>Embracing diversity enables our people to “make the difference” at FLEETCOR.</div><br>\n<div>\n<b>Our Values</b><b><br>\n</b></div><div>FLEETCOR’s culture reflects our history of fast growth and our continued drive for results. Our entrepreneurial spirit remains strong across our global workforce, and we reinforce these principles in our five core values:\n</div><ul><li>Innovation: Figure out a better way\n</li><li>Execution: Get it done quickly\n</li><li>Integrity: Do the right thing\n</li><li>People: We make the difference\n</li><li>Collaboration: Accomplish more together\n</li></ul><div>These values guide all of our employees and are infused in all aspects of our Company.
