Thank you.</b></p>\n<p>\nThis position will likely work remotely the entire summer. However, our preference is to hire someone who will be based in the Charlotte, NC area on the chance we're able to go back to office during the summer.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\nTHE POSITION</b></p>\n<p>\nOur former Summer Interns will tell you, LendingTree’s Internship Program is selective, challenging and structured to push the limits of what they thought they could do - and they wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. Are there easier ways to spend your summer? Absolutely. But a LendingTree Internship will help you grow professionally and also get you closer to landing a phenomenal job once you graduate – maybe even with LendingTree. Here’s what you can expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real work. The only person you’ll be getting coffee for at LendingTree is yourself. You’ll be doing professional level work that will have a real impact on the business</li>\n<li>Training. Sure you’ll learn a ton of industry skills as you contribute to your team every day, but you’ll also go through specific training on: crafting a phenomenal resume and LinkedIn profile, getting interviews and how to handle them, how to give a great presentation and more</li>\n<li>You’re not alone. In addition from the support from your team you’ll be assigned a Mentor outside of your department who will guide you and mentor you throughout the summer</li>\n<li>End of summer presentation. At the end of the summer every Intern gives a PPT presentation to Executives which will include a summary of what you accomplished, what you learned and 2 ideas that will either make the company money or save the company money</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>RESPONSIBILITIES</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work with other software engineers to implement code enhancements, new features and fixes</li>\n<li>Work on cutting-edge problems and architecture related to designing scalable and robust micro-services</li>\n<li>Build and develop new unit testing strategies for code that you write, ensuring maximum coverage and future extensibility</li>\n<li>Assist with ad-hoc code analysis, analyze time complexities and come up with better algorithms</li>\n<li>Own your work through all its stages (Requirement Gathering/Clarification, Code Analysis, Design and Development, Unit Testing, Helping QA Automate regression, Help support deployment scripts (we use Docker), Help with release and post-performance monitoring)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>QUALIFICATIONS</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very bright (3.7+ GPA required) undergrad or grad student who will be graduating in December 2021 or May 2022 (GPA must be listed on your resume to be considered)</li>\n<li>Preferred major: Computer Science or closely related field</li>\n<li>Ability to write code using dotnet/C# or Java</li>\n<li>Strong knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts</li>\n<li>Knowledge of algorithms and standard Design Patterns</li>\n<li>Motivated self-starter, with a high capacity for rapid learning and meticulous attention to detail</li>\n<li>Willingness to roll up sleeves and GET STUFF DONE!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>COMPANY</b></p>\n<p>\nLendingTree is the nation’s largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices. Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.</p>\n<p><b><i>\nWhat else you should know:</i></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re a publicly-traded company (TREE).</li>\n<li>We’ve welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.</li>\n<li>We’ve built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.</li>\n<li>We still make funny commercials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>CULTURE</b></p>\n<p>\nWe’re a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We’re collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you’ll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, <i>do</i> wear clothes to work!), and we’re pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, “Get Stuff Done”). Come work with us!</p>\n<p><i>\nLendingTree is the kind of company that not only promotes diversity and inclusion; we thrive because of these values.

As of 2011, there are 42 free trade agreements registered which cover 237 bilateral relationships and approximately 89% of the region’s trade volume. This scenario provides outstanding opportunities to deepen the regional integration at the level of SMEs, which account for slightly more than 10% of intraregional trade, and yet have vast importance to the region’s economy (they represent more than 90% of the region’s companies and more than 50% of total employment). In this context, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has made it an institutional priority to strengthen the international investment and commercial ties of SMEs in the region.\n</p><p>In addition, Internet usage in Latin America and the Caribbean grew nearly 891% in the past decade.

The IDB envisions transport services as a means towards a more inclusive region and to promote sustainable development. The knowledge strategy of the Division focuses on five strategic areas: Urban Transport, Mega Projects, Freight Logistics, Road Safety, and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). In addition, it also addresses four cross-cutting major challenges: Gender Equality, Sustainable Transport, Nearshoring, and Regional Integration, and Impact Evaluation. Furthermore, the division is actively promoting innovation in project planning, preparation, and/or operation of transport projects. From our perspective, innovation in transport can be understood as creating a differential factor (value-added) in every stage of a project life cycle: planning, preparation, execution, implementation, and operation; while bearing in mind that innovation goes beyond the incorporation of technology, and it is also related with developing and using new financing instruments, incorporating new theories to analyze and understand behavioral changes, and new regulation schemes; which allows to operate and deliver inclusive and efficient transport services.

However, our preference is to hire someone who will be based in the San Mateo, CA area on the chance we're able to go back to office during the summer.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\nTHE POSITION</b></p>\n<p>\nOur former Summer Interns will tell you, LendingTree’s Internship Program is selective, challenging and structured to push the limits of what they thought they could do - and they wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. Are there easier ways to spend your summer? Absolutely. But a LendingTree Internship will help you grow professionally and also get you closer to landing a phenomenal job once you graduate – maybe even with LendingTree. Here’s what you can expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real work. The only person you’ll be getting coffee for at LendingTree is yourself. You’ll be doing professional level work that will have a real impact on the business</li>\n<li>Training. Sure you’ll learn a ton of industry skills as you contribute to your team every day, but you’ll also go through specific training on: crafting a phenomenal resume and LinkedIn profile, getting interviews and how to handle them, how to give a great presentation and more</li>\n<li>You’re not alone. In addition from the support from your team you’ll be assigned a Mentor outside of your department who will guide you and mentor you throughout the summer</li>\n<li>End of summer presentation. At the end of the summer every Intern gives a PPT presentation to Executives which will include a summary of what you accomplished, what you learned and 2 ideas that will either make the company money or save the company money</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>RESPONSIBILITIES</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Troubleshoot and solve problems involving technology for LendingTree employees</li>\n<li>Manage request in a timely and accurate manner</li>\n<li>Work with other members of the team on a SharePoint migration</li>\n<li>Leverage a wide range of technologies, the cloud, AWS, SharePoint, etc. to help many areas of the business</li>\n<li>Help manage the Helpdesk inventory system</li>\n<li>Organize and catalog existing documentation</li>\n<li>Format information for internal and external communication – memos, emails, presentations, reports</li>\n<li>Assist with editing Helpdesk training videos</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <b>QUALIFICATIONS</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Undergrad or grad student (3.5+ GPA required) who will be graduating in Dec. 2021 or May 2022 (GPA must be listed on your resume to be considered)</li>\n<li>Preferred majors: Management Information Systems, Information Technology, Computer Science, Engineering, Business, Data science/analytics</li>\n<li>High-level understanding of computer equipment and operating systems</li>\n<li>Ideal candidate will have exp. putting computers together and taking them apart</li>\n<li>Good working knowledge of Microsoft Office (i.e., Word, Excel, Outlook)</li>\n<li>Excellent oral and written communication skills</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Willingness to roll up your sleeves and GET STUFF DONE.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>COMPANY</b></p>\n<p>\nLendingTree is the nation’s largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices. Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.</p>\n<p><b><i>\nWhat else you should know:</i></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re a publicly-traded company (TREE).</li>\n<li>We’ve welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.</li>\n<li>We’ve built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.</li>\n<li>We still make funny commercials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>CULTURE</b></p>\n<p>\nWe’re a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We’re collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you’ll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, <i>do</i> wear clothes to work!), and we’re pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, “Get Stuff Done”). Come work with us!</p>\n<p><i>\nLendingTree is the kind of company that not only promotes diversity and inclusion; we thrive because of these values. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion (or creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or military status.</i></p></div>"
