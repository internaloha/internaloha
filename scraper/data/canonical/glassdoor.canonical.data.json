That is to say, we want to motivate healthy habits - and reward people - in $$ for living healthfully. And we want to help users when they are sick - finding the right medical provider, service or company program that is best for them. For example, I am now earning reward points (that convert to cash) for tracking my daily workout, my sleep, and what I eat. And, on the other side of the equation, if you need an wrist X-ray for that carpal tunnel from either too much coding, or more likely too much texting – and then choose the best doctor for you. Whether that choice is based on quality, price, distance or all three – Castlight has you covered. Quick tip – go to an imaging center, not a hospital – our research shows you will save money and they all use the same equipment. Sure, Castlight provides much more like personalized recommendations, understandable summaries of your company’s benefit programs, a history of all your claims, and current HSA/HRA balances – and how much to go before your care is free for the rest of the year.<br><br>Our summer interns are an integral part of our team. You will work on real projects on our production system as part of our standard scrum teams. Thus, the specific work will vary by scrum team, but all interns will have the opportunity to write and test software in a web application framework, while partnering with a group of experienced software engineers who help and challenge them as they work on projects that matter to our customers.

When a customer hires a new employee, Rippling ships them a laptop that is preconfigured with the new employee's user account, all of the company's security settings, and any software the new employee needs. This makes onboarding easy for new hires, and saves hours of an IT admin's time.

When one of our customers hires an employee, our system automatically creates the employee's accounts in G Suite, Slack, Dropbox, GitHub, AWS, etc, adds the user to the right groups and permissions, and allows the employee to sign in to those services using SAML or RPass -- Rippling's end-to-end encrypted password manager. We work closely with our integration partners and our business development team to build new integrations, manage our existing partnerships, and most importantly, build an integration ecosystem that is a key long term moat for Rippling's business.<br>HRIS Team<br><br>The Human Resource Information Systems ( HRIS) team is responsible for building products for employee lifecycle management, employee experience management, compliance management, documents management and talent management. Each product as a stand-alone is part of a multi-billion dollar market.<br>Engineers working on this team will get to develop products that are used by Rippling customers and internal engineering teams, they will work on scaling the existing products, help in reducing latency and in making the products more secure.<br>Platform Team<br><br>The platform team builds both the product and technology foundations of Rippling. We're responsible for the core service framework, permissioning, and any other core technologies needed to write backend code at Rippling.<br><br>We're also responsible for core product platforms like data reporting products, workflows, search, and RQL (Rippling Query Language), which are both external and internal facing.

Through the SBTi Finance project, SBTi is also working with financial institutions to set portfolio-level SBTs and formally validating the targets that meet the initiative’s criteria. The aim of the project is for portfolio-level SBTs to become standard practice and for these targets to result in emissions reductions in the real economy. The project intends to raise the ambition of the finance sector by defining and promoting best practice in science-based target setting and providing methods, criteria, guidance and tools to reduce the barriers to adoption and implementation (i.e. actions that lead to atmospheric reductions of GHG concentrations). Within the broad ecosystem of organizations and value chains that link financial institutions with GHG emissions in the real economy, the SBTi Finance project is focused on ex ante targets at the asset-class level. The first version of the target setting framework for financial institutions was launched in October 2020 and will be updated on an annual basis as our understanding of how financial institutions can achieve emissions reductions in the real economy evolves.<br><br><b>Internship Summary</b><br><br>This position represents a unique opportunity to support one of WRI’s high impact initiatives to increase the ambition of financial institutions to set targets that lead to GHG emissions reductions in the real economy.

You will serve in a coordinating role for the SBTi Finance target setting framework team, helping to manage and ramp up the capacity of projects to develop various new resources with an emphasis on outreach and communications.

That is to say, we want to motivate healthy habits - and reward people - in $$ for living healthfully. And we want to help users when they are sick - finding the right medical provider, service or company program that is best for them. For example, I am now earning reward points (that convert to cash) for tracking my daily workout, my sleep, and what I eat. And, on the other side of the equation, if you need an wrist X-ray for that carpal tunnel from either too much coding, or more likely too much texting – and then choose the best doctor for you. Whether that choice is based on quality, price, distance or all three – Castlight has you covered. Quick tip – go to an imaging center, not a hospital – our research shows you will save money and they all use the same equipment. Sure, Castlight provides much more like personalized recommendations, understandable summaries of your company’s benefit programs, a history of all your claims, and current HSA/HRA balances – and how much to go before your care is free for the rest of the year.<br><br>Our summer interns are an integral part of our team. You will work on real projects on our production system as part of our standard scrum teams.

That is to say, we want to motivate healthy habits - and reward people - in $$ for living healthfully. And we want to help users when they are sick - finding the right medical provider, service or company program that is best for them. For example, I am now earning reward points (that convert to cash) for tracking my daily workout, my sleep, and what I eat. And, on the other side of the equation, if you need an wrist X-ray for that carpal tunnel from either too much coding, or more likely too much texting – and then choose the best doctor for you. Whether that choice is based on quality, price, distance or all three – Castlight has you covered. Quick tip – go to an imaging center, not a hospital – our research shows you will save money and they all use the same equipment. Sure, Castlight provides much more like personalized recommendations, understandable summaries of your company’s benefit programs, a history of all your claims, and current HSA/HRA balances – and how much to go before your care is free for the rest of the year.<br><br>Our summer interns are an integral part of our team. You will work on real projects on our production system as part of our standard scrum teams.
