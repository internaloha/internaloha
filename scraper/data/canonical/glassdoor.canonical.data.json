By combining deep expertise in molecular biology with advanced computational biology and machine learning techniques to recognize disease-associated patterns among billions of circulating, cell-free biomarkers, we are developing simple and accurate blood tests for early cancer detection and integrating the actionable insights into health systems to operationalize a machine learning feedback loop between care and science.</p><p>Our recent $270 Million Series C brings our financing to over $500 million from investors, including; Bain Capital, Perceptive Advisors, RA Capital, Polaris Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., GV (formerly Google Ventures), Roche Venture Fund, Kaiser Permanente Ventures, American Cancer Society’s BrightEdge Ventures, Data Collective Venture Capital, Novartis and Verily Life Sciences.</p><p>Our Science</p><p>Freenome is building technology to advance the understanding of cancer through multiple analytes derived from blood. These signals include cell-free DNA, methylation of cell-free DNA, cell-free RNA, circulating proteins, and immune profiling derived from thousands of prospective samples. By developing novel statistical learning methods and applying them to integrate various -omics datasets, Freenome is a leader in modeling specific biological mechanisms to capture disease-dependent signatures, including gene expression, immune response, tumor burden, the tissue of origin, and 3D chromatin structure.</p><p>By building comprehensive discovery datasets and modeling critical biological systems, Freenome is learning what biological changes are present within the blood between a variety of different disease states, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infections, drug response, and aging. The synthesis of Freenome’s datasets, cross-functional technical expertise, and audacious mission to discover biological truth, we seek to improve the lives of millions through early detection and early treatment of disease.</p><p>Our Culture</p><p>Freenomers are technical, creative, visionary, grounded, empathetic, and passionate. We build teams around divergent expertise, allowing us to solve problems and ascertain opportunities in unique ways. Freenomers are some of the most talented experts in their fields, joining together to advance healthcare, one breakthrough at a time.</p><p>We value empathy, integrity, and trust in one another, and we respect the diverse perspectives of our colleagues and those we serve. We assume positive intent and give each other the benefit of the doubt with the firm belief that we are a team working toward the same objectives. We believe in empowering and supporting each other in a collaborative and dynamic environment.</p><p>What does a successful person look like at Freenome?</p><p>Those who thrive at Freenome prioritize, manage, and execute their own goals with ownership and alignment with those of the company. They embrace our values of empathy, integrity, striving for greatness, servant leadership, trust, and holding themselves and their team accountable to these values. They crave collaboration with brilliant minds from disparate fields of study and believe that hiring and mentorship are fundamental to our success. Above all, they welcome and provide constructive feedback and criticism, trusting in others’ good intentions, and being secure in knowing that embracing mistakes is the best way to learn and grow. For those who pursue challenges, understudied problems, and want the opportunity to see their work impact the lives of millions of people affected by cancer every year, there’s no better place to be than Freenome.</p><p>Freenome is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity.

We strive to attract diverse, intellectually driven candidates who have a passion for sustainability and development. WRI provides many internship opportunities throughout the year in all our programs.<br><br>WRI is committed to advancing gender, racial, and social equity for human well-being in our mission and applies this principle to our organizational and programmatic practices.<br><br><br><b>Program Overview</b><br><br>Science Based Targets is a joint initiative by CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and WWF, in collaboration with the We Mean Business Coalition, intended to increase ambition on corporate climate action by driving the adoption of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with what the latest climate science says is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Through the SBTi Finance project, SBTi is also working with financial institutions to set portfolio-level SBTs and formally validating the targets that meet the initiative’s criteria. The aim of the project is for portfolio-level SBTs to become standard practice and for these targets to result in emissions reductions in the real economy. The project intends to raise the ambition of the finance sector by defining and promoting best practice in science-based target setting and providing methods, criteria, guidance and tools to reduce the barriers to adoption and implementation (i.e. actions that lead to atmospheric reductions of GHG concentrations). Within the broad ecosystem of organizations and value chains that link financial institutions with GHG emissions in the real economy, the SBTi Finance project is focused on ex ante targets at the asset-class level. The first version of the target setting framework for financial institutions was launched in October 2020 and will be updated on an annual basis as our understanding of how financial institutions can achieve emissions reductions in the real economy evolves.<br><br><b>Internship Summary</b><br><br>This position represents a unique opportunity to support one of WRI’s high impact initiatives to increase the ambition of financial institutions to set targets that lead to GHG emissions reductions in the real economy.

Hemorrhagic shock is the leading cause of death on the battlefield. The Battlefield Health &amp; Trauma (BHT) Center for Human Integrated Physiology (CHIP) has the only experimental model for the study of human hemorrhage in the Department of Defense (DoD). The Tri-Service Research Laboratory (TSRL) has the only DoD experimental model of poly-trauma in the genetically-closest surrogate to humans using non-human primates (NHP) that combines hemorrhage and tissue trauma similar to that experienced by our injured warfighters on the battlefield. As a result of the extensive databases generated from the collaborative efforts of these laboratories that employ both human and NHP experiments, there exists a requirement to assign an individual to provide support to data archiving and analysis.</p><p><b>Why should I apply?</b></p><p>Under the guidance of a mentor, you will gain hands-on experience to complement your education and support your academic and professional goals.

Within the broad ecosystem of organizations and value chains that link financial institutions with GHG emissions in the real economy, the SBTi Finance project is focused on ex ante targets at the asset-class level.

WRI provides many internship opportunities throughout the year in all our programs.<br><br>WRI is committed to advancing gender, racial, and social equity for human well-being in our mission and applies this principle to our organizational and programmatic practices.<br><br><br><b>Program Overview</b><br><br>Science Based Targets is a joint initiative by CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and WWF, in collaboration with the We Mean Business Coalition, intended to increase ambition on corporate climate action by driving the adoption of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with what the latest climate science says is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Through the SBTi Finance project, SBTi is also working with financial institutions to set portfolio-level SBTs and formally validating the targets that meet the initiative’s criteria. The aim of the project is for portfolio-level SBTs to become standard practice and for these targets to result in emissions reductions in the real economy. The project intends to raise the ambition of the finance sector by defining and promoting best practice in science-based target setting and providing methods, criteria, guidance and tools to reduce the barriers to adoption and implementation (i.e. actions that lead to atmospheric reductions of GHG concentrations). Within the broad ecosystem of organizations and value chains that link financial institutions with GHG emissions in the real economy, the SBTi Finance project is focused on ex ante targets at the asset-class level. The first version of the target setting framework for financial institutions was launched in October 2020 and will be updated on an annual basis as our understanding of how financial institutions can achieve emissions reductions in the real economy evolves.<br><br><b>Internship Summary</b><br><br>This position represents a unique opportunity to support one of WRI’s high impact initiatives to increase the ambition of financial institutions to set targets that lead to GHG emissions reductions in the real economy. You will join a team of highly motivated individuals, from WRI, WWF and CDP, working on science-based target setting for greenhouse gases. You will serve in a coordinating role for the SBTi Finance target setting framework team, helping to manage and ramp up the capacity of projects to develop various new resources with an emphasis on outreach and communications. Examples of potential projects include developing a process for tracking project deliverables and milestones, establishing a formal agenda setting and notetaking framework for team calls and meetings and following up on action items, and managing project content for the SBTi newsletter and information sharing across team members.<br><br><b>Internship Learning Outcomes</b><br><br>Project Management and Operations (50%)<br><ul><li>Structure project work plans and ensure sufficient resources are allocated to the different workstreams Monitor the project’s multiple work-streams</li><li>ensuring all aspects of a complex and ambitious program are progressing in a timely and effective manner.</li><li>Help with recruiting if necessary, e.g. drafting JDs, identify and reach out to potential candidates</li><li>Actively monitor the project’s online forum and ensure key queries are resolved by the relevant subject matter expert or the whole project team</li><li>ideate and implement innovative ways to improve the forum</li></ul>Events, Meetings, and Outreach (35%)<br><ul><li>Organize weekly internal project meetings; take minutes and track follow-up as necessary</li><li>Manage project shared folders and access by team members Support planning of workshops, webinars, and meetings with the project expert advisory group</li><li>Manage project content for the SBTi newsletter</li></ul>Stakeholder Management (15%)<br><ul><li>Manage and monitor contact lists of the project, including adding/updating current members in the expert advisory group and a broader stakeholder advisory group</li></ul><b>Internship Qualifications</b><br><ul><li>Pursuing or completed Bachelor’s or Master’s Degree in relevant field such as Environmental Sciences, Finance, Business, Environmental or Energy Economics, Environmental Policy, Environmental or Chemical Engineering</li><li>Excellent attention to detail and experience managing or monitoring multiple projects simultaneously</li><li>A self-starter with experience working in a loose management environment across multiple organizations</li><li>Ability to think creatively and be flexible to changes in project scope, focus or timeline</li><li>Excellent computer skills in Microsoft Office Suite, particularly with Power Point, Outlook and Teams.</li><li>Ability to upward manage, corralling busy people and holding them accountable to tasks</li><li>Strong communication skills -ability to communicate complex concepts clearly, both orally and in writing, with fluency in English.</li></ul><b>Compensation</b><br>The pay range for this internship opportunity is between $15-18/hour, commensurate with qualifications.<br><br><b>Duration and Location</b><br><ul><li>This is a full-time, six-month internship with flexible start and end dates based on the student’s availability and need for the project.</li><li>This is a remote-based internship with the option to work out of the Washington D.C. office once it reopens.</li><li>WRI will provide a laptop for the duration of your internship.</li></ul><br><b>How to Apply</b><br>Please submit a resume and cover letter.
