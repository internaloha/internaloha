Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines, to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.</div><div></div><div><br>The Microsoft Research Computational Social Science (CSS) group is widely recognized as a leading center of CSS research, lying at the intersection of computer science, statistics and the social sciences. Our approach is motivated by two longstanding difficulties for traditional social science: first, that simply gathering observational data on human activity is extremely difficult at scale and over time; and second, that running experiments to manipulate the conditions under which these measurements are made (e.g., randomly assigning large sets of interacting people to treatment and control groups) is even more challenging and often impossible.</div><div></div><div><br>In the first category, we exploit digital data that is generated by existing platforms (e.g., email, web browsers, search, social media) to generate novel insights into individual and collective human behavior. In the second category, we design novel “virtual lab” experiments that allow for larger scale, longer time horizons, and greater complexity and realism than is possible in physical labs.</div><h2><b>Responsibilities</b></h2><div>Interns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world’s best researchers, interns learn, collaborate, and network for life.

When one of our customers hires an employee, our system automatically creates the employee's accounts in G Suite, Slack, Dropbox, GitHub, AWS, etc, adds the user to the right groups and permissions, and allows the employee to sign in to those services using SAML or RPass -- Rippling's end-to-end encrypted password manager. We work closely with our integration partners and our business development team to build new integrations, manage our existing partnerships, and most importantly, build an integration ecosystem that is a key long term moat for Rippling's business.<br>HRIS Team<br><br>The Human Resource Information Systems ( HRIS) team is responsible for building products for employee lifecycle management, employee experience management, compliance management, documents management and talent management.
