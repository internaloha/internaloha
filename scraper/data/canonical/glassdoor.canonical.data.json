A proven record of publications (at least one first-author paper in reputed conferences such as NeurIPS, COLT, UAI, ICML, AISTATS, JMLR, PAMI, and others) and prototyping skills in terms of developing algorithms, in any language, is critical.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>As an industry R&amp;D laboratory, we pursue theoretical and applied research to feed into the other. Like academia, knowledge dissemination is through the publication of papers in reputed journals, conferences and workshops, and patents.

This difference is paramount. Someone who just has ML and Python on their CVs do not qualify them for RL.</li>\n<li>Good candidates may have (a) published in the field of RL in top conferences i.e., original contribution, or (b) have a codebase that is original in GitHub/Bitbucket.</li></ul><br>\n<p>\n</p><p><b>Apply Today!<br>\n</b></p><br>\n<br>\n<h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><div><b>Why Kelly</b><b>®</b><b>?</b></div></h3><p></p>\n<p>By partnering with Kelly® Technology, you’ll have direct connections to top companies around the globe—giving you the chance to put your tech skills to work on some of today’s most intriguing, innovative, and high-visibility projects.

A proven record of publications (at least one first-author paper in reputed conferences such as NeurIPS, COLT, UAI, ICML, AISTATS, JMLR, PAMI, and others) and prototyping skills in terms of developing algorithms, in any language, is critical.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>As an industry R&amp;D laboratory, we pursue theoretical and applied research to feed into the other. Like academia, knowledge dissemination is through the publication of papers in reputed journals, conferences and workshops, and patents.

This difference is paramount. Someone who just has ML and Python on their CVs do not qualify them for RL.</li>\n<li>Good candidates may have (a) published in the field of RL in top conferences i.e., original contribution, or (b) have a codebase that is original in GitHub/Bitbucket.</li></ul><br>\n<p>\n</p><p><b>Apply Today!<br>\n</b></p><br>\n<br>\n<h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><div><b>Why Kelly</b><b>®</b><b>?</b></div></h3><p></p>\n<p>By partnering with Kelly® Technology, you’ll have direct connections to top companies around the globe—giving you the chance to put your tech skills to work on some of today’s most intriguing, innovative, and high-visibility projects.

A proven record of publications (at least one first-author paper in reputed conferences such as NeurIPS, COLT, UAI, ICML, AISTATS, JMLR, PAMI, and others) and prototyping skills in terms of developing algorithms, in any language, is critical.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>As an industry R&amp;D laboratory, we pursue theoretical and applied research to feed into the other. Like academia, knowledge dissemination is through the publication of papers in reputed journals, conferences and workshops, and patents.

This difference is paramount. Someone who just has ML and Python on their CVs do not qualify them for RL.</li>\n<li>Good candidates may have (a) published in the field of RL in top conferences i.e., original contribution, or (b) have a codebase that is original in GitHub/Bitbucket.</li></ul><br>\n<p>\n</p><p><b>Apply Today!<br>\n</b></p><br>\n<br>\n<h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><div><b>Why Kelly</b><b>®</b><b>?</b></div></h3><p></p>\n<p>By partnering with Kelly® Technology, you’ll have direct connections to top companies around the globe—giving you the chance to put your tech skills to work on some of today’s most intriguing, innovative, and high-visibility projects.

Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. <b>Careers Start Here.</b></div><div></div><div><br>\nAt Fred Hutch, we believe that the innovation, collaboration, and rigor that result from diversity and inclusion are critical to our mission of eliminating cancer and related diseases. We seek employees who bring different and innovative ways of seeing the world and solving problems. Fred Hutch is in pursuit of becoming an antiracist organization. We are committed to ensuring that all candidates hired share our commitment to diversity, antiracism, and inclusion.</div><p></p><div><br>\nThe Bioinformatics Intern will work under the supervision of a senior scientist in the Clinical Research Division on translational genomics research projects focusing on cancer genomics and genetics.

Data types span custom single cell RNA sequencing (combined with genotyping), to targeted DNA sequencing to exome-level bulk sequencing. Our group uses workflow managers including Cromwell (using WDL based workflow descriptions), thus work will involve the creation and testing of end to end workflows for use on multiple data sets using both local HPC resources (SLURM) and leveraging AWS resources when appropriate. Development of suitable data visualizations for genetic heterogeneity will also be a focus.

Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. <b>Careers Start Here.</b></div><div></div><div><br>\nAt Fred Hutch, we believe that the innovation, collaboration, and rigor that result from diversity and inclusion are critical to our mission of eliminating cancer and related diseases. We seek employees who bring different and innovative ways of seeing the world and solving problems. Fred Hutch is in pursuit of becoming an antiracist organization. We are committed to ensuring that all candidates hired share our commitment to diversity, antiracism, and inclusion.</div><p></p><div><br>\nThe Bioinformatics Intern will work under the supervision of a senior scientist in the Clinical Research Division on translational genomics research projects focusing on cancer genomics and genetics.

Data types span custom single cell RNA sequencing (combined with genotyping), to targeted DNA sequencing to exome-level bulk sequencing. Our group uses workflow managers including Cromwell (using WDL based workflow descriptions), thus work will involve the creation and testing of end to end workflows for use on multiple data sets using both local HPC resources (SLURM) and leveraging AWS resources when appropriate. Development of suitable data visualizations for genetic heterogeneity will also be a focus.
