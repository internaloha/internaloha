The platform also enables benefit leaders to communicate and measure their programs while driving employee engagement with targeted, relevant communications.</div><div>To date, Castlight has partnered with more than 240 large enterprise customers, spanning millions of lives, to improve healthcare outcomes, lower costs, and increase benefits satisfaction.</div><br><b>Description</b><br>Castlight Health is seeking a Software Engineering Intern to join our Web Applications team based in San Francisco, CA.<br><br>Castlight wants to help users navigate the world of healthcare and sickcare. That is to say, we want to motivate healthy habits - and reward people - in $$ for living healthfully. And we want to help users when they are sick - finding the right medical provider, service or company program that is best for them. For example, I am now earning reward points (that convert to cash) for tracking my daily workout, my sleep, and what I eat.

Whether that choice is based on quality, price, distance or all three – Castlight has you covered. Quick tip – go to an imaging center, not a hospital – our research shows you will save money and they all use the same equipment.

Self-driving cars, autonomous delivery vehicles, and autonomous construction vehicles, among others, are getting increasingly close to widespread deployment. However, fundamental research questions still need to be addressed for us to achieve full vehicle autonomy. For instance, how can we: Remove the traditional barriers among perception, prediction, and planning in order to improve overall system performance? Equip autonomous vehicles with online and offline assurances that meet the standards for safety-critical systems? Ensure that autonomous vehicles work seamlessly in new places?</p><p></p><p>These are some of the exciting questions that the newly-established NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicle Research Lab will be tackling. We will bring together a diverse, interdisciplinary research team working on core topics in vehicle autonomy, ranging from perception and prediction to planning and control, as well as critical related areas such as decision making under uncertainty, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and the verification and validation of safety-critical AI systems. Our focus will be on basic research; lab members will be encouraged to publish their work and open-source code. NVIDIA is well known for its team culture, and lab researchers will be able to closely interact with others within the company who are experts in perception systems, machine learning, and robotics. There is an opportunity to make a strong impact on products, while having the freedom and bandwidth to conduct ground-breaking publishable research.</p><p></p><h2><b>What you'll be doing:</b></h2><ul><li>Designing and implementing cutting-edge techniques in the field of vehicle autonomy.</li><li>Publishing your original research.</li><li>Collaborating with other research team members, a diverse set of internal product teams, and external researchers.</li><li>Transferring technology you've developed to relevant product groups.</li></ul><p></p><h2><b>What we need to see:</b></h2><ul><li>Pursuing a PhD in Robotics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering or related field.</li><li>Relevant research experience in the field of vehicle / robot autonomy.</li><li>Strong knowledge of theory and practice of vehicle / robot autonomy, or a related area with a strong interest in connecting your work to autonomous vehicles.</li><li>A track record of research excellence with your work published in top conferences and journals such as RSS, ICRA, IJRR, NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, TAC, etc, and other research artifacts such as software projects.</li><li>Exceptional programming skills in Python; C++ and parallel programming (e.g., CUDA) are a plus.</li><li>Knowledge of common machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow.</li><li>Strong communication and interpersonal skills are required along with the ability to work in a dynamic, research-focused team.</li></ul><p></p><p>Are you dedicated, upbeat and dynamic with excellent analytical ability?

These signals include cell-free DNA, methylation of cell-free DNA, cell-free RNA, circulating proteins, and immune profiling derived from thousands of prospective samples. By developing novel statistical learning methods and applying them to integrate various -omics datasets, Freenome is a leader in modeling specific biological mechanisms to capture disease-dependent signatures, including gene expression, immune response, tumor burden, the tissue of origin, and 3D chromatin structure.</p><p>By building comprehensive discovery datasets and modeling critical biological systems, Freenome is learning what biological changes are present within the blood between a variety of different disease states, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infections, drug response, and aging. The synthesis of Freenome’s datasets, cross-functional technical expertise, and audacious mission to discover biological truth, we seek to improve the lives of millions through early detection and early treatment of disease.</p><p>Our Culture</p><p>Freenomers are technical, creative, visionary, grounded, empathetic, and passionate.
