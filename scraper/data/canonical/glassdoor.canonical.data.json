The platform also enables benefit leaders to communicate and measure their programs while driving employee engagement with targeted, relevant communications.</div><div>To date, Castlight has partnered with more than 240 large enterprise customers, spanning millions of lives, to improve healthcare outcomes, lower costs, and increase benefits satisfaction.</div><br><b>Description</b><br>Castlight Health is seeking a Software Engineering Intern to join our Web Applications team based in San Francisco, CA.<br><br>Castlight wants to help users navigate the world of healthcare and sickcare. That is to say, we want to motivate healthy habits - and reward people - in $$ for living healthfully. And we want to help users when they are sick - finding the right medical provider, service or company program that is best for them. For example, I am now earning reward points (that convert to cash) for tracking my daily workout, my sleep, and what I eat. And, on the other side of the equation, if you need an wrist X-ray for that carpal tunnel from either too much coding, or more likely too much texting – and then choose the best doctor for you. Whether that choice is based on quality, price, distance or all three – Castlight has you covered. Quick tip – go to an imaging center, not a hospital – our research shows you will save money and they all use the same equipment. Sure, Castlight provides much more like personalized recommendations, understandable summaries of your company’s benefit programs, a history of all your claims, and current HSA/HRA balances – and how much to go before your care is free for the rest of the year.<br><br>Our summer interns are an integral part of our team. You will work on real projects on our production system as part of our standard scrum teams. Thus, the specific work will vary by scrum team, but all interns will have the opportunity to write and test software in a web application framework, while partnering with a group of experienced software engineers who help and challenge them as they work on projects that matter to our customers.

We are working to address critical challenges that the world must overcome this decade in order to secure a sustainable future for people and the planet: climate change, energy, food, forests, water, sustainable cities, and the ocean.<br><br>Internships at WRI are learning experiences designed for current students, recent graduates, and other candidates who wish to gain knowledge about a specific area of our work. We strive to attract diverse, intellectually driven candidates who have a passion for sustainability and development.

Through the SBTi Finance project, SBTi is also working with financial institutions to set portfolio-level SBTs and formally validating the targets that meet the initiative’s criteria. The aim of the project is for portfolio-level SBTs to become standard practice and for these targets to result in emissions reductions in the real economy. The project intends to raise the ambition of the finance sector by defining and promoting best practice in science-based target setting and providing methods, criteria, guidance and tools to reduce the barriers to adoption and implementation (i.e. actions that lead to atmospheric reductions of GHG concentrations). Within the broad ecosystem of organizations and value chains that link financial institutions with GHG emissions in the real economy, the SBTi Finance project is focused on ex ante targets at the asset-class level. The first version of the target setting framework for financial institutions was launched in October 2020 and will be updated on an annual basis as our understanding of how financial institutions can achieve emissions reductions in the real economy evolves.<br><br><b>Internship Summary</b><br><br>This position represents a unique opportunity to support one of WRI’s high impact initiatives to increase the ambition of financial institutions to set targets that lead to GHG emissions reductions in the real economy.

That is to say, we want to motivate healthy habits - and reward people - in $$ for living healthfully. And we want to help users when they are sick - finding the right medical provider, service or company program that is best for them. For example, I am now earning reward points (that convert to cash) for tracking my daily workout, my sleep, and what I eat. And, on the other side of the equation, if you need an wrist X-ray for that carpal tunnel from either too much coding, or more likely too much texting – and then choose the best doctor for you. Whether that choice is based on quality, price, distance or all three – Castlight has you covered. Quick tip – go to an imaging center, not a hospital – our research shows you will save money and they all use the same equipment. Sure, Castlight provides much more like personalized recommendations, understandable summaries of your company’s benefit programs, a history of all your claims, and current HSA/HRA balances – and how much to go before your care is free for the rest of the year.<br><br>Our summer interns are an integral part of our team. You will work on real projects on our production system as part of our standard scrum teams. Thus, the specific work will vary by scrum team, but all interns will have the opportunity to write and test software in a web application framework, while partnering with a group of experienced software engineers who help and challenge them as they work on projects that matter to our customers.

Through the SBTi Finance project, SBTi is also working with financial institutions to set portfolio-level SBTs and formally validating the targets that meet the initiative’s criteria. The aim of the project is for portfolio-level SBTs to become standard practice and for these targets to result in emissions reductions in the real economy. The project intends to raise the ambition of the finance sector by defining and promoting best practice in science-based target setting and providing methods, criteria, guidance and tools to reduce the barriers to adoption and implementation (i.e. actions that lead to atmospheric reductions of GHG concentrations). Within the broad ecosystem of organizations and value chains that link financial institutions with GHG emissions in the real economy, the SBTi Finance project is focused on ex ante targets at the asset-class level. The first version of the target setting framework for financial institutions was launched in October 2020 and will be updated on an annual basis as our understanding of how financial institutions can achieve emissions reductions in the real economy evolves.<br><br><b>Internship Summary</b><br><br>This position represents a unique opportunity to support one of WRI’s high impact initiatives to increase the ambition of financial institutions to set targets that lead to GHG emissions reductions in the real economy.

That is to say, we want to motivate healthy habits - and reward people - in $$ for living healthfully. And we want to help users when they are sick - finding the right medical provider, service or company program that is best for them. For example, I am now earning reward points (that convert to cash) for tracking my daily workout, my sleep, and what I eat. And, on the other side of the equation, if you need an wrist X-ray for that carpal tunnel from either too much coding, or more likely too much texting – and then choose the best doctor for you. Whether that choice is based on quality, price, distance or all three – Castlight has you covered. Quick tip – go to an imaging center, not a hospital – our research shows you will save money and they all use the same equipment. Sure, Castlight provides much more like personalized recommendations, understandable summaries of your company’s benefit programs, a history of all your claims, and current HSA/HRA balances – and how much to go before your care is free for the rest of the year.<br><br>Our summer interns are an integral part of our team.

Our approach is motivated by two longstanding difficulties for traditional social science: first, that simply gathering observational data on human activity is extremely difficult at scale and over time; and second, that running experiments to manipulate the conditions under which these measurements are made (e.g., randomly assigning large sets of interacting people to treatment and control groups) is even more challenging and often impossible.</div><div></div><div><br>In the first category, we exploit digital data that is generated by existing platforms (e.g., email, web browsers, search, social media) to generate novel insights into individual and collective human behavior.
