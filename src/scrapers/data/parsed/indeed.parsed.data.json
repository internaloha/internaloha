The production of cement accounts for over 8% of global CO2 emissions. bioMASON is driven by scaled proof that there is a better way to reduce these emissions. bioMASON's products include proprietary manufacturing processes and materials. bioMASON’s products make it possible to manufacture in ambient temperatures using locally available materials, without using fuel or heat sources. bioMASON enables savings in energy costs and zero carbon emissions. bioMASON offers the opportunity to manufacture biological cement materials with a revolutionary process that does not use fossil fuels. Instead, products are grown in less than 72 hours using natural biocement® as a binder for aggregates. Aggregate materials are waste and locally sourced. Biocement Products enable manufacturing to take place in ambient temperatures, using existing concrete equipment. bioMASON made products with biocements are tested in ASTM standard labs for strength and durability and exhibit higher performance. bioMASON is distinguished by its unique technology, manufacturing costs, the use of local materials, greater environmental responsibility, customizable manufacturing process, and relatively low capital requirements.</p><p>The first commercially available product is bioLITH® Tile.

Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities - we're just getting started.\n<br>\nThe Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) Research Team brings together a world-class team of researchers, developers, and engineers to create the future of virtual and augmented reality, which together will become as universal and essential as smartphones and personal computers are today. And just as personal computers have done over the past 45 years, AR and VR will ultimately change everything about how we work, play, and connect. We are developing all the technologies needed to enable breakthrough AR glasses and VR headsets, including optics and displays, computer vision, audio, graphics, brain-computer interfaces, haptic interaction, eye/hand/face/body tracking, perception science, and true telepresence. Some of those will advance much faster than others, but they all need to happen to enable AR and VR that are so compelling that they become an integral part of our lives. In particular, the FRL Research audio team is focused on two goals; creating virtual sounds that are perceptually indistinguishable from reality, and redefining human hearing. See more about our work here: https://tech.fb.com/inside-facebook-reality-labs-research-the-future-of-audio/ These two initiatives will allow us to connect people by allowing them to feel together despite being physically apart, and allow them to converse in even the most difficult listening environments. The Audio Hardware Research team is looking for innovative PhD student interns interested in one or more of the following areas: * Acoustic transducer design* Acoustic simulations (finite element, boundary element, electro-acoustics, acoustic-solid interactions)* Physiological and bio-signal sensing technologies and processing* Advanced acoustic materials (e.g. meta-materials, broad-band sound attenuator, etc)* Hearing mechanics* Embedded real-time signal processing (active noise control, echo cancellation, etc)* Vibration characterization, analysis, and controlOur internships are sixteen (16) to twenty four (24) weeks long and we have various start dates throughout the year.\n<br>\n<ul><li>Work closely with FRL researchers on an innovative project proposal, timeline and milestones</li><li>\nCommunicate research plans, progress and results</li></ul>\n<br>\n<ul><li>Currently has, or is in the process of obtaining, a PhD degree in the field of Acoustics, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering or related STEM fields</li><li>\n2+ years experience with independent research as evidenced by publications and/or conference presentations</li><li>\n2+ years experience with computer aided design, acoustic simulation tools or high level programming language such as MATLAB or python</li><li>\nInterpersonal experience: cross-group and cross-culture collaboration</li><li>\nMust obtain work authorization in country of employment at the time of hire, and maintain ongoing work authorization during employment</li></ul>\n<br>\nFacebook is proud to be an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.

No matter what company you join there will always be new technologies. Over the course of the summer we want to help you grow your skill set while also giving you a chance to have an impact on our product and clients - and it doesn’t hurt to have some fun while doing it.</p><p>\nAlthough we are currently all working remotely we hope to be back in our office by next summer where we have a stocked fridge, cold brew on tap, and an endless supply of snacks.
