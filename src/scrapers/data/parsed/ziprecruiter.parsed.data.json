        "description": "Company Description\n\n\n\nHello, we’re OpenPlay!\n\nWe’re looking for a full-stack engineer to work with us on our web-based music distribution application. You’ll work with us to design, develop, and deploy new application features for one of the world’s largest record companies. This is a full-time position that can be local (Los Angeles) or fully remote.\n\nWhat’s an OpenPlay?\n\nWe’re a small software team making distribution and workflow products for some of the world’s largest music companies. We’re big on testing, constant incremental improvement, craftsmanship, and pragmatism, and so far have been able to use those buzzwords to quickly deliver lots of features to keep the music industry running. We strive to make well engineered software that looks great and is friendly to use. We’re collaborative, supportive, enjoy learning, and most of all enthusiastic about building new things and making old things better.\n\nJob Description\n\n\n\nWhat you’ll be doing:\n\nRefining requirements. We follow an agile process focused on rapid incremental delivery. You’ll take rough features born from an interesting idea, a customer request, or an overdue refactor (or a bug ), and collaborate designing the user experience and technical direction necessary to release the next (or first) version.\n\nProgramming. It wouldn’t be an engineering position without some programming. We try to get to this step with minimal planning time so we can see how an idea takes shape in the real world. Our languages of choice are Ruby and Javascript. We tend to practice outside-in development: most features start with a rough end-to-end (or system, or integration, etc.) test, then we attach some UI, give it an endpoint to communicate with, and finally add in the persistence layer. You’ll be responsible for your feature iterations from start to finish, but you’ll have a team to help and design support for visual polish.\n\nDeploying. We offload and automate devops as much as possible, but a small part of every feature is still getting it deployed and ensuring it’s working as expected. We deploy features to production a few times per day on a typical day.\n\nSkills we’re looking for:\n\nPractical experience in full stack web application development. At least a few years working on both the server and client side of production web applications. Experience with any client/server development (i.e. mobile) would probably also be pretty applicable. Console game development sounds really cool but probably wouldn’t transfer over as well. TI-86 calculator programming experience wouldn’t be a great fit either.\n\nAcademic knowledge of software development. In addition to being able to make something work, you’ll need to be able to research and articulate why it’s a particularly good solution. A computer science degree is one good barometer we’re looking for, but we understand it’s not the only path to understanding engineering principles and isn't required.\n\nA desire to collaborate with others. As a team we often discuss new and better ways to approach problems. We do code reviews and we write comments explaining our rationale when code looks smelly. If you enjoy thinking about new solutions to old problems, and can balance that with small, iterative, deliveries, you’ll probably enjoy working with us.\n\nQualifications\n\n\n\nKey technology experience:\n\nRuby. Experience with ruby would be ideal, but experience with other object-oriented dynamic languages would transfer over pretty well, especially python (you won’t be the only convert). Extensive experience in any programming language might fit as well. If you’re new to Ruby but enjoy object-oriented programming you’ll probably love it.\n\nJavascript. Experience with other semi-prototypal web-browser-based scripting languages with a nonsense hodge-podge standard library would probably transfer over too, but happily for the world we’re not sure any exist. In any case, the more experience you have with Javascript the better.\n\nTesting. The heart of our workflow is a full suite of end-to-end tests that we rely on to rapidly and safely build and deploy new features and refactor old code. Prior experience with test driven development or behavior driven development would be a big plus.\n\nMore specific technologies we use:\n\nOur server-side code is MVC-structured and built around Sequel (ORM) and Sinatra. If you’re familiar with Rails or similar MVC frameworks you’ll feel at home pretty quickly.\n\nOur core distribution product (OpenPlay Music) is a traditional multi-page application driven by server-side HTML and using Javascript to apply bits of dynamic behavior.\n\nOur project management and workflow tool is a more recent single-page-application built in React and backed by Ruby communicating over JSON.\n\nWe enjoy both of them and think they are both appropriate technologies for different types of applications.\n\nWe do things typical of web applications like:\n\nStore data in and query from a relational database (PostgreSQL)\n\nIndex data and query it with filtering and full text searching (Elasticsearch)\n\nHandle slow tasks with background processing\n\nPush notifications to clients with WebSockets\n\nExport XML files, PDFs, CSVs, Excel spreadsheets, and other formats that just won’t seem to go away\n\nCommunicate with lots of external systems across all manner of APIs\n\nProvide a JSON API for our customers to build on top of\n\nOffload as much devops as possible to Heroku\n\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\nCompetitive compensation\n\nMedical, dental, and vision insurance\n\nWork life balance: We expect you to generally work 40 hours/week but understand that sometimes it’s summer. We might rarely have a big push where we end up working long hours. The last time this happened was in 2019 for about a week. The time before that was in 2016 for about 3 weeks.\n\nFlexible work and vacation schedule: We have found so far that if the work is enjoyable it isn’t necessary to police when people are working. So we try to keep the work enjoyable.\n\nFree to work remote: Our process works just as well in person or remote. It can sometimes even feel remote at the office when we’re sitting next to each other talking on Slack with our headphones in.\n\nCompany Minecraft server with lots of odd elevated stone platforms.\n\nOffice by the beach with a small-but-growing collection of vinyl figurines.\n\nAll your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines."

Additional information about transcripts is in this document. Basic Requirement for Electrical Engineer/Computer Engineer/Electronics Engineer: A. Degree: Bachelor's degree (or higher degree) in engineering. To be acceptable, the program must: (1) lead to a bachelor's degree (or higher degree) in a school of engineering with at least one program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology; OR (2) include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics. OR B. Combination of Education and Experience: College-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the physical and mathematical sciences underlying engineering, and (2) a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the engineering sciences and techniques and their applications to one of the branches of engineering. The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following:\n1. Professional registration or licensure-Current registration as an Engineer Intern (EI), Engineer in Training (EIT), or licensure as a Professional Engineer (PE) by any State, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions. 2. Written Test-Evidence of having successfully passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination, or any other written test required for professional registration, by an engineering licensure board in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. 3. Specified academic courses-Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and that included the courses specified in A above. The courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of an engineering program. 4. Related curriculum-Successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in an appropriate scientific field, e.g., engineering technology, physics, chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology, may be accepted in lieu of a degree in engineering, provided the applicant has had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. Ordinarily there should be either an established plan of intensive training to develop professional engineering competence, or several years of prior professional engineering-type experience, e.g., in interdisciplinary positions. Electrical Engineer/Computer Engineer/Electronics Engineer: Specialized Experience: One year of specialized experience which includes: planning and conducting technical integration of projects; analyzing project requirements; implementing plans; preparing contractual documentation or reports; and providing technical guidance. This definition of specialized experience is typical of work performed at the next lower grade/level position in the federal service (GS-11). Some federal jobs allow you to substitute your education for the required experience in order to qualify. For the GS-12 grade level, you must meet the qualification requirement using experience alone--no substitution of education for experience is permitted. You will be evaluated on the basis of your level of competency in the following areas:\nInfrastructure DesignOral CommunicationProject ManagementSystems Testing and Evaluation Time in Grade Requirement: Applicants who have held a General Schedule (GS) position within the last 52 weeks must have 52 weeks of Federal service at the next lower grade or equivalent (GS-11).\nEducation\nFOREIGN EDUCATION: If you are using education completed in foreign colleges or universities to meet the qualification requirements, you must show the education credentials have been evaluated by a private organization that specializes in interpretation of foreign education programs and such education has been deemed equivalent to that gained in an accredited U.S. education program; or full credit has been given for the courses at a U.S. accredited college or university.

        "description": "Summary\nThis is a Direct Hire Authority (DHA) solicitation utilizing the DHA for Certain Personnel of the DoD Workforce to recruit and appoint qualified candidates to positions in the competitive service. About the Position: Hawaii is a beautiful state, but has a high cost of living. Hawaii has many outdoor activities all year round including surfing, paddling, diving, fishing, and hiking. It is highly recommended that research be done about the cost of living in Hawaii prior to applying.\nResponsibilities\nSupervise the work of a team composed of civil engineers and engineering technicians.\nEstablish and maintain detailed quality control requirements, schedules and control methods for assigned projects.\nInterpret contract plans and specifications and directs enforcement for all assigned projects under construction.\nRecommend changes in designs, specifications, and schedules to accommodate unforeseen conditions at the jobsite, which may impact contract progress.\nAssist in negotiations with contractors for modifications relating to changes in plans, schedules, substitution of materials and construction requirements.\nRequirements\nConditions of Employment\nQualifications\nWho May Apply: US Citizens In order to qualify, you must meet the education and/or experience requirements described below. Experience refers to paid and unpaid experience, including volunteer work done through National Service programs (e.g., Peace Corps, AmeriCorps) and other organizations (e.g., professional; philanthropic; religious; spiritual; community; student; social). You will receive credit for all qualifying experience, including volunteer experience. Your resume must clearly describe your relevant experience; if qualifying based on education, your transcripts will be required as part of your application. Additional information about transcripts is in this document. Basic Requirement for Engineer: A. Degree: Bachelor's degree (or higher degree) in engineering. To be acceptable, the program must: (1) lead to a bachelor's degree (or higher degree) in a school of engineering with at least one program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET); OR (2) include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics. OR B. Combination of Education and Experience: College-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the physical and mathematical sciences underlying engineering, and (2) a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the engineering sciences and techniques and their applications to one of the branches of engineering. The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following: 1. Professional registration or licensure - Current registration as an Engineer Intern (EI), Engineer in Training (EIT), or licensure as a Professional Engineer (PE) by any State, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions. 2. Written Test - Evidence of having successfully passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination, or any other written test required for professional registration, by an engineering licensure board in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. 3. Specified academic courses - Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and that included the courses specified in A above. The courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of an engineering program. 4. Related curriculum - Successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in an appropriate scientific field, e.g., engineering technology, physics, chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology, may be accepted in lieu of a degree in engineering, provided the applicant has had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. Ordinarily there should be either an established plan of intensive training to develop professional engineering competence, or several years of prior professional engineering-type experience, e.g., in interdisciplinary positions. AND In addition to meeting the basic requirement above, to qualify for this position you must also meet the qualification requirements listed below: SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE: To qualify based on your experience, your resume must describe at least one year of experience which prepared you to do the work in this job. Specialized experience is defined as implementing engineering concepts, principles and practices in the planning, design, and construction of military construction projects; evaluating and approving construction design, proposals, specifications, and performance and compliance with contract provisions; reviewing contracting operations, bid requests, and award contracts to ensure consistency with the project requirements; and monitor the expenditure of funds to assure construction projects remain within budget.\nThis definition of specialized experience is typical of work performed at the next lower grade/level position in the federal service GS-11.\nEducation\nFOREIGN EDUCATION: If you are using education completed in foreign colleges or universities to meet the qualification requirements, you must show the education credentials have been evaluated by a private organization that specializes in interpretation of foreign education programs and such education has been deemed equivalent to that gained in an accredited U.S. education program; or full credit has been given for the courses at a U.S. accredited college or university.
