If the appeal is unsuccessful, the MOW may try to go through the UPIV process one year after the decision date.\n\nEEO\n \n\nAll qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status and any other protected class under state or federal law.",

Using a keen eye, you’ll develop software and tools in support of many of our high-impact technology platforms such as operating systems, networks, databases and more. While we’re growing in the software business, you’ll still need to see the big picture and watch for hardware compatibility while even potentially influencing design.\nWho You’ll Work With\nOur hardworking team members are busy programming magic across the globe on teams such as Engineering, Information Technology, Supply Chain, Customer Experience, Security and Trust, etc.\nYou would play a crucial role in driving next-gen software innovations including cloud, mobile, desktop or security spaces. On any of these teams, you'll get hands-on experience working with applications that make technology accessible no matter what device they’re on. See the possibilities when creativity meets design and build solutions which will transform how we work, live, learn, and play.\nMinimum Qualifications:\n* Pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or related program\n* Up-to-date on programming and scripting languages: C/C++, Python, Java\nPreferred Qualifications:\n* Knowledge of Linux, Networking concepts, OS fundamentals, Embedded Development, and/or ML\n* Hands on QA, Testing, and/or Debugging skills\n* Experience with Databases, Web Application Development, and Web Services\nWhy Cisco\n#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.\nWe embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re \"old\" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can’t put us in a box.\nBut \"Digital Transformation\" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\nDay to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\nSo, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!\nCisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis.\nCisco will consider for employment, on a case by case basis, qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.",
