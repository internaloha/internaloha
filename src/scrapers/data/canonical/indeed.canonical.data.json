The inherent complexity of the process and the limited size and availability of agriculturally relevant datasets has hampered progress in fully understanding crop growth to date. However, as an industry leader and with access to unique and increasingly rich agricultural datasets, The Climate Corporation is positioned to make significant advances in understanding this problem.\nIn addition to its complexity, there are a number of practical challenges to modeling crop growth. These include the heterogeneity of the data in terms of its feature modality and sampling frequency, lack of explanatory features, and unpredictable quality of the data. Multi-task learning has recently gained popularity in the field of deep learning to help tackle the challenges of similarly complicated and poorly constrained real-world problems including self-driving vehicles, natural language processing and numerous medical applications. As a deep learning intern you will explore the application of multi-task learning to modeling crop growth.\nWhat You Will Do:\nDevelop novel models to solve an increasingly relevant global problem using unprecedented agricultural datasets\nTest and develop your own creative solutions with ample computational resources\nCollaborate with domain experts from a variety of backgrounds (e.g. breeding, agronomy, plant pathology, engineering, statistics, etc.)\nPositively impact farmers and business applications across our suite of products\nBasic Qualifications\nCurrently enrolled in a graduate program in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, or a related discipline with a focus on deep learning\nProficient in python and at least one deep learning framework (tensorflow, JAX, pytorch, etc.)\nExperience implementing custom deep learning models\nDemonstrable ability to apply concepts from current deep learning publications\nPreferred Qualifications\nFamiliarity with multi-task learning, meta learning, or related sub fields\nCurrent PhD candidate\nExperience publishing research\nExperience developing models on spatial and/or temporal datasets (e.g. using RNNs, CNNs, or attention mechanisms)\nExperience developing models using heterogeneous or multi-modal datasets\nStrong analytical, written, and verbal communication skills\nWhat We Offer:\nOur environment is extremely engaging and fast-paced, with a diverse set of top engineers, agronomists, and statisticians working together to provide the best possible products and experiences for our customers.\nWe offer competitive pay and perks.\nYou’ll get 1:1 mentoring from a talented and motivated employee on your team.\nYou’ll have the opportunity to work on real projects with experienced employees and have a direct impact on the company. (Our internships are not summer camp!)\nWe regularly host meet-up groups and tech-talks and encourage participation in relevant workshops and conferences\nYou’ll have the opportunity to interact with key executives and leaders.\nLearn more about our team and our mission:\nThe Climate Corporation - The Technology Behind Making A Difference\nhttps://youtu.be/c5TgbpE9UBI\n\nClimate aims to create a welcoming and collaborative environment for our employees in which a diverse set of perspectives and voices are represented and celebrated.\nAs part of our dedication to the diversity of our workforce, The Climate Corporation is committed to Equal Employment Opportunity and does not discriminate based on race, religion, color, national origin, ethnicity, gender, sex (including pregnancy), protected veteran status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or any unlawful criterion existing under applicable federal, state, or local laws.
