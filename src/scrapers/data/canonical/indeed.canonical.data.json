Our solutions combine hardware and software to bring real-time visibility, analytics, and AI to operations across various industries. Samsara's fast-growing team is headquartered in San Francisco, with offices in San Jose, Atlanta, and London. Our team has raised $930M from Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, Tiger Global, Dragoneer, AllianceBernstein Holding LP, Franklin Templeton, General Atlantic, Sands Capital Management and Warburg Pincus LLC.\n\nAt Samsara, we welcome all. All sizes, colors, cultures, sexes, beliefs, religions, ages, people. We depend on the unique approaches of our team members to help us solve complex problems. We are committed to increasing diversity across our team and ensuring that Samsara is a place where people from all backgrounds can make an impact.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe are looking for talented engineers to join our backend infrastructure, firmware, and full-stack teams! Please note we only have internship opportunities during Summer 2021.\n\nBackend infrastructure engineers design and develop the infrastructure that powers Samsara's IoT platform. You will work on scaling our data ingestion and storage systems to support more and more connected devices, and work with engineers throughout the company to make new types of data analysis possible.\n\nFirmware engineers develop the software that powers our hardware devices. While some of your work may involve working with low-level microcontrollers, your time will largely be spent developing in Golang (most of our devices run Linux environments!). You will work on anything from creating control interfaces for new hardware to designing server-device communication protocols.\n\nFull-stack, backend focus engineers design and develop features across a broad surface area with tangible impact on active and future customers. You will tackle engineering challenges ranging from architecting data structures for mass data collection to presenting data analytics in intuitive and performant ways on web and mobile.\n\nFull-stack, frontend focus engineers develop user interfaces that present the data collected from thousands of devices in intuitive ways. You will work directly with the design and product teams to identify solutions and iterate quickly based on feedback. The features you build will provide actionable insights for our customers' operations, and may involve anything from developing our design systems to performance engineering.\n\nWe use Golang for our firmware and backend, Typescript and React for our web client, GraphQL to fetch data from our backend, and React Native for our mobile app. Direct experience with these technologies is not required.\n\nAn ideal candidate would:\n\nComplete a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science or a related technical field between Fall/Winter 2021 - Summer 2022\nHave built or worked on production applications\nEnjoy understanding our users and what would make their day to day processes easier to manage\nLove shipping features that are immediately used by our customers\nSeek to iterate on new products based on customer feedback\n\nWorking at Samsara has its perks: private medical and dental insurance, flexible vacation, growth and development opportunities, regular virtual team and company events. Post COVID, we'll be back in our global offices with numerous in-office perks.\n\nRegarding COVID-19\n\nWith the spread of COVID-19 globally, Samsara's offices will remain closed until further notice with the exception of phase 1 employees that require access to hardware and lab equipment.\n\nOur primary concern is for the health and well-being of our employees as well as candidates. We have transitioned all interviews and new hire onboarding to be conducted virtually via Zoom video conferencing. We have allowed employees to work from countries and states where Samsara is a registered entity through June 2021. All employees (except field roles) are expected to return to our offices when they reopen.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns before applying, feel free to contact us at jobs@samsara.com"
