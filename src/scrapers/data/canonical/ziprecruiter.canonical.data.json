We are backed by some of the top VC's, including Gates Frontier (Bill Gates' investment fund) and Khosla Ventures with real world customers who are excited about our technologies.\n\nRobotics on a planetary scale is not just our tagline but our north star to why we do what we do.\n\nOur Co-Founders:Founder, CEO Dr. Adrian Kaehler has a long history of innovation: he has been an inventor on many patents, as well as the author of numerous technical papers and articles in a variety of subjects ranging from particle physics to biometrics to architecture to robotics. He has led projects in a wide variety of technical domains including commercial, industrial, and military and ranging in scope from boutique to global scale mass production, on land, in the air, in space, and under the oceans.\n\nCo-Founder Dr. Chris Cianci holds undergraduate degrees in Physics (Occidental College, 2001) and Electrical Engineering (Caltech, 2003), and completed his doctorate on Distributed Robotics at L'Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland (2009). He has done extensive work in robotic autonomy, ranging from autonomous vehicles to one of the first consumer autonomous home vacuum cleaners, shipping millions of units worldwide. When forced to drive himself (because the self-driving cars aren't quite ready yet), he can often be found traveling in a 1974 MGB that he is in the process of restoring himself.\n\nWhy we are looking for someone like you:\n\nWe are seeking junior, senior, master's or doctorate computer science/software engineering students with an interest in robotics and machine learning.
