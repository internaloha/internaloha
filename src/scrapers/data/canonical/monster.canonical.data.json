We saw that the world was moving away from hardware and software to solve these problems and instead wanted a scalable service that would work around the world.</span></h4><h4><span style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">To deliver that, we built one of the world's largest networks. </span><span style=\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\">Every day, we see more than 1 billion unique IP addresses.

Do you want to help?<br>As a software engineering intern at Duo, you will work as an embedded member of a software engineering team to solve some of the most challenging problems in today’s security industry. You may work on building our mobile app, securing the cloud, helping us assess device security, or helping us kill VPNs and passwords. On our team you will find: musicians, hackers, hikers, gardeners, birders, and board game enthusiasts all working together to make Duo the most loved and trusted company in security.<br>Our teams are focused on questions like:<br>* How do we balance security and ease of use?<br>* How do we make strong security ubiquitous, so that organizations of all sizes can afford to be protected with strong security?<br>* How do we make security software so easy to use that users don’t resist it?<br>If these sound interesting to you, come join our team. Our people are our secret weapon. And together we build solutions that are easy, effective, dependable, and enduring.<br>We are committed to cultivating and preserving a culture of inclusion and connectedness. We are able to grow and learn better together with a diverse team of employees. The collective sum of the individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, innovation, self-expression, and talent that our employees invest in their work represents not only part of our culture, but our reputation and Duo’s achievement as well. In recruiting for our team, we welcome the unique contributions that all potential candidates can bring in terms of their education, opinions, culture, ethnicity, race, sex, gender identity and expression, nation of origin, age, languages spoken, veteran’s status, color, religion, disability, sexual orientation and beliefs.<br>And if this role is exciting to you, we encourage you to apply even if you don’t meet all 100% of the description or qualifications. Finally and most importantly, we are a proud Equal Opportunity Employer.<br>Does this sound like you?<br>* You love working as part of a fast paced team.<br>* You can tackle tasks independently in support of your team's goals.<br>* You want to actively participate in creating a great place to work.<br>* You drive results for the business, while upholding our \"kinder than necessary\" value.<br>* You want to work on a problem (internet security) that has deep consequences at both a personal and geopolitical scale.<br>* You know how to code and are currently enrolled in an accredited degree granting program.<br>Additional skills you have:<br>* Deep understanding of computer science fundamentals and software engineering with an aptitude for learning new technologies<br>* Experience with a modern programming language or framework (C/C++, Python, Java, Objective-C)<br>* A bias toward action and an intense desire to grow your skill set<br>3 reasons why you should apply:<br>* You want to work on important projects that ship to 1000’s of customers; no throwaway intern work here<br>* You are eager to learn about the ins and outs of professional software development at a dynamic organization<br>* You love collaborating with, guiding, and learning from high-performing peers on software projects<br>Tips to make your application stand out: While academics are a strong signal to us, good grades aren't the only thing that matters to us.<br>* Have a technical side project? Tell us about it. (Previous examples include an intern who built a Pacman emulator.)<br>* Past internships are a great way to show how you've made an impact and applied your knowledge to a real customer problem.<br>* We love to hear about experiences you’ve had where you’ve: learned something new, taken leadership / ownership of a project, helped / taught others, and/or delivered results.<br>We hope this list makes what we look for less ambiguous, but it’s not meant to be limiting! Tell us what makes you unique.<br>Internship Details:<br>* We’re hiring Software Engineering interns based out of our Ann Arbor, Michigan and Austin, Texas offices<br>* Program dates are: May 24 through August 20<br>* Roles are full time and 40 hours per week, Monday - Friday<br>* Generous pay and employee perks<br>#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.<br>We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re \"old\" (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can’t put us in a box!<br>But \"Digital Transformation\" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)<br>Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.<br>So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!<br>Cisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis.<br>Cisco will consider for employment, on a case by case basis, qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records."
