        "description": "Over the next 10 years, biotech will fundamentally rewrite the way we live. Gene editing and cell therapy will dramatically change how we treat cancer and other major illnesses. Biofuels and biomaterials will transform the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, and the makeup of everyday objects. Crop science and synthetic biology will produce sustainable and ethical food. Benchling's mission is to accelerate the research that propels us towards this future, and magnify its impact, through modern software.Every day, scientists around the world use Benchling in their efforts to solve humanity's most pressing problems. For these scientists, Benchling is the central technology they use to conduct their research.Benchling was founded by a team of MIT graduates and has raised funding from Benchmark, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and Y Combinator. Our customers include pharmaceutical giants, leading biotechs, and the world's most renowned research institutes.We're looking for interns to join our Summer 2021 intern class. As an intern, you'll be entrusted with a significant degree of ownership to work alongside full-time engineers who hail from MIT, Google, Facebook, Stripe, and more. Our past interns have built DNA search engines, key pieces of AWS infrastructure, and analytics pipelines. You'll learn how a startup works and how to build high quality software, quickly.RESPONSIBILITIES Work with and learn from a strong team of engineers hailing from MIT, CMU, Facebook, Stripe, and more. We grow our interns through mentorship and ownership. Own projects end-to-end, from initial design, to prototype, to large-scale rollout. Design and implement backend models and API endpoints for complex scientific workflows. Design and implement rich frontend components and architecture. We build and operate one of the largest, richest React applications out there and power complex scientific analyses.YOU Are pursuing a BA/BS and/or MA/MS degree in computer science, math or a related technical field. Have had a prior Software Engineer Internship or similar experience. Build software with a product-first approach. You ship code quickly and care about the real world impact of your code. Have strong abilities in problem solving and iterating on feedback. Enjoy ownership and building key pieces of product. Are interested in learning more about life science (prior knowledge is not required; desire to learn is a must).YOU MIGHT WORK ONCheck out our blog post for some examples of past intern work. Here are some other examples of recent and future projects: Tools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues. Complex querying and visualization tools\nThe big advantage of keeping all your data stored in one system is that you can query that data all at once, without digging up multiple sources. This works best when you can query Benchling the same way you can query a database: by choosing from a large number of possible filters on any related objects, joining together various sources, and performing aggregations. We want to enable this in a user-friendly experience, without leaving your browser. A customizable computation platform\nBiologics are typically large protein complexes composed of a number of shared parts. We want to let scientists specify computations that can aggregate data across all of these related entities to surface derived values, which can be used in everything from data analysis to naming schemes. Scientists may develop custom protein analysis algorithms or proprietary validation logic - they'll be able to hook in custom code and push that computation to Benchling. Data warehouse as a product - customers can click a button and spin up a fully-managed, query-able warehouse with all their Benchling data in one place. Customers get the full power of Redshift/Postgres without having to manage ETL pipelines or tune Postgres configuration values. A new permissions system\nOur existing permission system relies on Read/Write/Admin access that can only be applied at the top level of the file hierarchy. To roll out to enterprises with 500+ users, we need to offer them fine-grained control around exactly what actions a user can take and let them manage these in a hierarchical fashion.OUR VALUES Empower through information. We explain the \"why\" behind every decision, unless there are highly sensitive circumstances. We're honest about how we're doing, especially in difficult times. We believe that sharing information builds trust and enables better decision-making. Rely on tenacity. Hard work is one of the greatest factors to determine success and is fully under our control. We must make the most of every day by bringing the highest level of determination. Dreaming big is not enough. Raise the bar. Pushing ourselves and others to improve will be uncomfortable and at times result in failure. However, it's critical to our success. We're dedicated to creating a place where everyone feels challenged to improve. Build a lever. We choose to build tools and infrastructure that will help others make world-changing innovations. There's less glory in it, but in the words of Archimedes, \"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.\"PERKS AND BENEFITS Work with a talented yet humble team Monthly health & wellness stipend Happy hours, company and team wide social events Medical, dental, and vision insuranceWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Post COVID, we’ll be back in our global offices with numerous in-office perks.\n\nRegarding COVID-19\n\nWith the spread of COVID-19 globally, Samsara's offices will remain closed until further notice with the exception of phase 1 employees that require access to hardware and lab equipment.\n\nOur primary concern is for the health and well-being of our employees as well as candidates. We have transitioned all interviews and new hire onboarding to be conducted virtually via Zoom video conferencing. We have allowed employees to work from countries and states where Samsara is a registered entity through June 2021. All employees (except field roles) are expected to return to our offices when they reopen.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns before applying, feel free to contact us at jobs@samsara.com"

        "description": "Overview\n\nHunter Engineering Company is a global leader in the development and manufacturing of computer based automotive service equipment. We are in search of enthusiastic and self-motivated sophomores, juniors, or seniors with a major or minor in a field of study cohesive with Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or Computer Science.\n\nResearch & Development, Software\n\nCreate small test programs for a variety of projects. Test programs are typically written in C++, C#, VBA, Python or PowerShell depending on what is being tested and what the student is more comfortable using. Microsoft Visual Studio is the typical IDE used but another popular alternative is Visual Studio Code.\nResearch and test different approaches to completing a task. An example would be a program to detect an object and blur it out in an image. We recently tested 3 different ways to do the blurring and picked out the best one based on speed, functionality and best fit into a larger program.\nModify existing software to fix bugs, make improvements and add functionality. On larger software projects that span several co-op students, it is not uncommon to make software changes to the project as we make more discoveries.\n\n\nEquipment Evaluation\n\nEvaluate various commercial equipment to determine if it can be used in Hunter products or internally for R&D or in manufacturing. Example commercial equipment from past work includes bar code scanners, Microsoft Kinect, and Google glasses.\n\nProduct and R&D Testing\n\nThere is always a need to test products, software, hardware and experiments during R&D. Testing typically happens if there is a big push to get a new product released. Testing also occurs during the experimental part of R&D. Testing can range from just “trying it out” to execution of a more formal test plan under the direction of a project engineer. When testing new ideas, the results are usually formalized in a useable and effective manner in order to analyze the results against objectives.\n\nComputations and Calculations\n\nPerform engineering computations and calculations. Example calculations from past work include vehicle speed from Hunter measurements, optimal camera lens focal length for a given distance, pixel versus distance changes, and optimal angle of incidence for light on a subject to get the best results from Hunter equipment.\n\nEngineering Documentation\n\nCreate a written document of research performed such that another coop could repeat the research.\nCreate instructions on getting a project running which would include installing software, software projects to compile, hardware required and the testing process. These instructions would typically be used by other student coops and eventually more broadly across the company.\n\n\nThe individual will be involved in a variety of projects which may include:\n\nSoftware installation, design, and testing (at least 80% of the work)\nTest and evaluate prototypes\nMinor analysis and engineering calculations\nElectronic design, prototype construction and evaluation (EE/CompE)\n\nIt will be our intent and purpose to provide the individual with real world experience, which includes assisting in the progression of a product from concept stage to production. The work done by co-ops in this position is applied to actual Hunter products. The work is normally very individualized even if you are working in a larger group. Our goal is to provide an experience that will be an important, effective first step in the career of a future project engineer.\n\nAlso visit our website for testimonials from previous co-ops\nhttps://www.hunter.com/about-us/careers/co-op/\n\nMinimum 3.0 GPA (must be on resume)\nMajor studies in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering or Computer Science\nAt least some programming experience\nExcellent communication skills."

You'll learn how a startup works and how to build high quality software, quickly.\n\n\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\n\n\n\nWork with and learn from a strong team of engineers hailing from MIT, CMU, Facebook, Stripe, and more. We grow our interns through mentorship and ownership.\nOwn projects end-to-end, from initial design, to prototype, to large-scale rollout.\nDesign and implement backend models and API endpoints for complex scientific workflows.\nDesign and implement rich frontend components and architecture. We build and operate one of the largest, richest React applications out there and power complex scientific analyses.\n\n\n\n\nYOU\n\n\n\n\nAre pursuing a BA/BS and/or MA/MS degree in computer science, math or a related technical field.\nHave had a prior Software Engineer Internship or similar experience. \nBuild software with a product-first approach. You ship code quickly and care about the real world impact of your code.\nHave strong abilities in problem solving and iterating on feedback.\nEnjoy ownership and building key pieces of product.\nAre interested in learning more about life science (prior knowledge is not required; desire to learn is a must).\n\n\n\n\nYOU MIGHT WORK ON\n\n\n\n\nTools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues.\nComplex querying and visualization tools - The big advantage of keeping all your data stored in one system is that you can query that data all at once, without digging up multiple sources. This works best when you can query Benchling the same way you can query a database: by choosing from a large number of possible filters on any related objects, joining together various sources, and performing aggregations. We want to enable this in a user-friendly experience, without leaving your browser.\nA customizable computation platform - Biologics are typically large protein complexes composed of a number of shared parts. We want to let scientists specify computations that can aggregate data across all of these related entities to surface derived values, which can be used in everything from data analysis to naming schemes. Scientists may develop custom protein analysis algorithms or proprietary validation logic - they'll be able to hook in custom code and push that computation to Benchling.\nData warehouse as a product - customers can click a button and spin up a fully-managed, query-able warehouse with all their Benchling data in one place. Customers get the full power of Redshift/Postgres without having to manage ETL pipelines or tune Postgres configuration values.\nA new permissions system - Our existing permission system relies on Read/Write/Admin access that can only be applied at the top level of the file hierarchy. To roll out to enterprises with 500+ users, we need to offer them fine-grained control around exactly what actions a user can take and let them manage these in a hierarchical fashion.\n\n\n\n\nOUR VALUES\n\n\n\n\nEmpower through information. We explain the “why” behind every decision, unless there are highly sensitive circumstances. We're honest about how we're doing, especially in difficult times. We believe that sharing information builds trust and enables better decision-making.\nRely on tenacity. Hard work is one of the greatest factors to determine success and is fully under our control. We must make the most of every day by bringing the highest level of determination. Dreaming big is not enough.\nRaise the bar. Pushing ourselves and others to improve will be uncomfortable and at times result in failure. However, it's critical to our success. We're dedicated to creating a place where everyone feels challenged to improve.\nBuild a lever. We choose to build tools and infrastructure that will help others make world-changing innovations. There's less glory in it, but in the words of Archimedes, \"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.\"\n\n\n\n\nPERKS AND BENEFITS\n\nWork with a talented yet humble team\nMonthly health & wellness stipend\nHappy hours, company and team wide social events\nMedical, dental, and vision insurance\n\n\n\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records."

        "description": "The Problem\n\nAt its core, education has a fundamental data problem: schools run on legacy infrastructure that's impossible for developers to build on top of. We're on a mission to replace the terrible things that engineers have to do to build classroom software (think nightly CSV FTP transfers) with an API that feels more like Facebook's or Stripe's. On the school-facing side, we're looking to become a single place where schools can discover, integrate, and evaluate the dozens of in-class applications they're using.\n\nWhen we started seven years ago, four schools used Clever. Today, Clever is used by over 78,000 schools, making it the fastest-growing company in education. We're looking for talented engineers who want to help us build Clever into something every school, student, and teacher relies on.\n\nA Day in the Life\n\nInterns at Clever work alongside full-time engineers, improving existing products and creating apps that live on top of Clever. Our very first intern wrote an iPhone app on the Clever platform that spread to over a thousand schools on the day it was released. Another intern wrote an app that let schools provision Google accounts, which now manages over 2 million student and teacher accounts.\n\nClever is mostly written in Typescript, Javascript, Node.js, and Go.\n\nThis is exclusively a summer 2021 (May - August / June - September) opportunity.\n\nRequirements\n\nMust be graduating in or before June 2022. Why is this? Clever only offers internships to college students who will be graduating within 9 months of their internship's completion because we view internships as a path to a full-time offer. The internship program lets us identify and mentor future engineers, while offering the the intern a chance to see what it's like to be part of the Clever team. At the end of the internship, we hope to be able to build on a great summer by extending our interns an offer to come back and join us!\nRelevant coursework in computer science.\nPast projects demonstrating strong coding ability.\nA desire to grow as an engineer through collaboration, code reviews, and learning new languages/technologies.\nExcellent communication skills\nA desire to work in a diverse, highly collaborative team environment"
