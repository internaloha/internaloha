It will also be mostly remote, though there will be some need to work with other engineers wherever the prototype is located in the NYC area (given Covid, we'll have to figure out how to do that safely).\n\nIdeally, if the internship goes well from both our sides, we would like bring on the candidate in a part time equity position after the internship ends (and if the company grows we’d love for it to turn into a full time position), but if you are just interested in a Fall internship and not necessarily joining the company, that’s fine too!"

        "description": "Background\nCOVID-19 has hijacked the plans of many, and has the potential to put the global economy on life support. People that should have shuffled off to jobs or internships have had their hopes dashed. But there are plenty of engineers who still want to learn, and we can help.  \n\nOur goal is to teach you how to become as productive as quickly as possible. You’ll learn engineering and big data best practices, and be exposed to business strategies that you wouldn’t get at “bigco” for two more decades. At least. This is an unpaid opportunity, so if you’re looking to maximize your pay, go apply to internship programs at Facebook or Google. If you’re lucky, someone might look at your code one day. \n\nIf you want to write code that will be immediately useful and work with the largest offline data science company that both Google and Facebook turn to for item-level data, then we have opportunities for you. With COVID-19 nothing is a given, but we guarantee that we will further the career of those willing to work, learn, and hustle, whether with our company or elsewhere.\n\nCompany Profile\nSociety is producing increasing volumes of data yet brick and mortar has not kept up with the opportunities. That’s not only troubling for your main street merchant, but also for the multi billion-dollar industries that surround the brick and mortar ecosystem: suppliers, distributors, utility operators, real estate funds, and others. \n\nWhatsBusy is the offline point of sale (POS) data monopoly. Really. We access petabytes of POS data from tens of thousands of merchants and proprietary data from the card networks (think Visa, Mastercard, AMEX) and are using intelligent, prescriptive analytics built on the back of data science to solve these challenges. From helping merchants better allocate labor to giving Budweiser insights on what promotions to run, we’re providing much needed modernization to an industry (offline commerce) that’s arguably stuck in the middle ages. \nWhy You Shouldn’t Apply\nYou thrive in environments with zero accountability and negligible execution. You like punching the clock from 9-5 and not a minute more. You want to work on “problems” that are already solved and a guaranteed roadmap 10 years out. Titles are important. \n\nWhy You Should Apply\nYou hate predefined roles based on your age / “experience”. You hate micromanagement. You like building new industries from the ground up. You love learning and being around experts. You are a self-starter. You want to create something important and think too many startups are pointless (how about Uber for mustache combs?). You love data and believe its intelligent application is the future.\n\nAbout the Role\nWhatsBusy is searching for someone who can build and manage front end software products. You must own your work. You will be exposed to marketing, strategy, and business development at senior levels. You must love data, believe in the power of data, and have a natural curiosity to solve real problems with data. You should understand 80/20 and have a visceral aversion to performing the same task twice. The right candidate will question, push back, and know when to run full speed. \n\nGeneral Responsibilities\nWorking with development teams to build and iterate products, including issue tracking, Q&A, change management, and issue resolution. Interaction with product management, senior leadership, and partners/customers to build and iterate solutions that drive tangible ROI.\n\nExperience\nDevelopment\nComfortable in front end mode\nCan optimize performance of systems and code\nCan quickly find ways to understand new technologies\nWell versed with design best practices\nWell versed in UI / UX principles\nWell versed in PWA (progressive web apps)\n\nTech Tools\nJQuery, Bootstrap/Sass, HTML5/CSS3, RESTful APIs, Git,\n\nNice to Haves\nPhotshop, Figma, ES6\n\nExpected Projects\nBilling and trials management products\nCustomer onboarding optimization\nSearch interfaces and data visualization\nScheduling interfaces"

        "description": "The Problem\nAt its core, education has a fundamental data problem: schools run on legacy infrastructure that's impossible for developers to build on top of. We're on a mission to replace the terrible things that engineers have to do to build classroom software (think nightly CSV FTP transfers) with an API that feels more like Facebook's or Stripe's. On the school-facing side, we're looking to become a single place where schools can discover, integrate, and evaluate the dozens of in-class applications they're using.\n\nWhen we started seven years ago, four schools used Clever. Today, Clever is used by over 78,000 schools, making it the fastest-growing company in education. We're looking for talented engineers who want to help us build Clever into something every school, student, and teacher relies on.\nA Day in the Life\nInterns at Clever work alongside full-time engineers, improving existing products and creating apps that live on top of Clever. Our very first intern wrote an iPhone app on the Clever platform that spread to over a thousand schools on the day it was released. Another intern wrote an app that let schools provision Google accounts, which now manages over 2 million student and teacher accounts. \n\nClever is mostly written in Typescript, Javascript, Node.js, and Go.\n\nThis is exclusively a summer 2021 (May - August / June - September) opportunity. \nRequirements\n\nMust be graduating in or before June 2022. Why is this? Clever only offers internships to college students who will be graduating within 9 months of their internship’s completion because we view internships as a path to a full-time offer. The internship program lets us identify and mentor future engineers, while offering the the intern a chance to see what it's like to be part of the Clever team.  At the end of the internship, we hope to be able to build on a great summer by extending our interns an offer to come back and join us!\nRelevant coursework in computer science.\nPast projects demonstrating strong coding ability.\nA desire to grow as an engineer through collaboration, code reviews, and learning new languages/technologies.\nExcellent communication skills\nA desire to work in a diverse, highly collaborative team environment"

Gene editing and cell therapy will dramatically change how we treat cancer and other major illnesses. Biofuels and biomaterials will transform the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, and the makeup of everyday objects. Crop science and synthetic biology will produce sustainable and ethical food. Benchling’s mission is to accelerate the research that propels us towards this future, and magnify its impact, through modern software.\n\nEvery day, scientists around the world use Benchling in their efforts to solve humanity's most pressing problems. For these scientists, Benchling is the central technology they use to conduct their research.\n\nBenchling was founded by a team of MIT graduates and has raised funding from Benchmark, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and Y Combinator. Our customers include pharmaceutical giants, leading biotechs, and the world's most renowned research institutes.\n\nWe're looking for interns to join our Summer 2021 intern class. As an intern, you'll be entrusted with a significant degree of ownership to work alongside full-time engineers who hail from MIT, Google, Facebook, Stripe, and more. Our past interns have built DNA search engines, key pieces of AWS infrastructure, and analytics pipelines. You'll learn how a startup works and how to build high quality software, quickly.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\n\nWork with and learn from a strong team of engineers hailing from MIT, CMU, Facebook, Stripe, and more. We grow our interns through mentorship and ownership.\nOwn projects end-to-end, from initial design, to prototype, to large-scale rollout.\nDesign and implement backend models and API endpoints for complex scientific workflows.\nDesign and implement rich frontend components and architecture. We build and operate one of the largest, richest React applications out there and power complex scientific analyses.\n\n\nYOU\n\n\nAre pursuing a BA/BS and/or MA/MS degree in computer science, math or a related technical field.\nHave had a prior Software Engineer Internship or similar experience. \nBuild software with a product-first approach. You ship code quickly and care about the real world impact of your code.\nHave strong abilities in problem solving and iterating on feedback.\nEnjoy ownership and building key pieces of product.\nAre interested in learning more about life science (prior knowledge is not required; desire to learn is a must).\n\n\nYOU MIGHT WORK ON\n\nCheck out our blog post for some examples of past intern work. Here are some other examples of recent and future projects:\n\n\nTools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues.\nComplex querying and visualization tools - The big advantage of keeping all your data stored in one system is that you can query that data all at once, without digging up multiple sources. This works best when you can query Benchling the same way you can query a database: by choosing from a large number of possible filters on any related objects, joining together various sources, and performing aggregations. We want to enable this in a user-friendly experience, without leaving your browser.\nA customizable computation platform - Biologics are typically large protein complexes composed of a number of shared parts. We want to let scientists specify computations that can aggregate data across all of these related entities to surface derived values, which can be used in everything from data analysis to naming schemes. Scientists may develop custom protein analysis algorithms or proprietary validation logic - they'll be able to hook in custom code and push that computation to Benchling.\nData warehouse as a product - customers can click a button and spin up a fully-managed, query-able warehouse with all their Benchling data in one place. Customers get the full power of Redshift/Postgres without having to manage ETL pipelines or tune Postgres configuration values.\nA new permissions system - Our existing permission system relies on Read/Write/Admin access that can only be applied at the top level of the file hierarchy. To roll out to enterprises with 500+ users, we need to offer them fine-grained control around exactly what actions a user can take and let them manage these in a hierarchical fashion.\n\n\nOUR VALUES\n\n\nEmpower through information. We explain the “why” behind every decision, unless there are highly sensitive circumstances. We're honest about how we're doing, especially in difficult times. We believe that sharing information builds trust and enables better decision-making.\nRely on tenacity. Hard work is one of the greatest factors to determine success and is fully under our control. We must make the most of every day by bringing the highest level of determination. Dreaming big is not enough.\nRaise the bar. Pushing ourselves and others to improve will be uncomfortable and at times result in failure. However, it's critical to our success. We're dedicated to creating a place where everyone feels challenged to improve.\nBuild a lever. We choose to build tools and infrastructure that will help others make world-changing innovations. There's less glory in it, but in the words of Archimedes, \"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.\"\n\n\nPERKS AND BENEFITS\n\n\nWork with a talented yet humble team\nCompetitive compensation & equity package\n401k\nMedical, dental, and vision insurance\nMonthly health & wellness stipend\nWeekly virtual social events, and annual company retreats\n*$1,000 work-from-home stipend\n\n\nIn following best practices and safety protocols, all Benchling employees are expected to work remotely until we are further advised that it is safe for employees to resume work in their respective office locations.   \n\n*To support remote work conditions, Benchling provides each employee a one-time stipend of $1,000 upon commencing employment, and additional discounted employee purchase plans for home-office equipment.  \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We also consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law, including but not limited to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance."
