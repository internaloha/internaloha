My friend who initially started the development of this project is no longer able to contribute due to urgent matters and I'm hoping to find the right person to complete the build and launch the product with me. It can be a great oppertuity to collobrate together and get something tangible on the app store with out any overhelming undertaking. \n\nSince the product is basically a to-do list with some extra sauce, it shouldn't be too labor intensive to finish for someone who knows what they are doing or willing to learn as they go.  I would estimate about 1 more week of full time work or 2-3 weeks while doing this on the side, is all it takes to get it launch ready. So I am not requiring any long term commitment. (Ideally this is a fun, short term project with a definitive end goal of getting something launched)\n\n(This is being built with React Native for both iOS and Android)\n\nAs listed in the post details, I am not able to offer upfront salary but am happy to offer equity in the project for the right person for the role. If interested, please let me know your time availability to work on the project and how soon you can jump in. Thanks for reading!",

        "description": "👋👋👋IMPORTANT the ideal candidate will have 5+ years of React expereince that they can point us to ( Preact experience is a huge bonus ). \n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nPlease read through this entire listing before applying. If you feel like it’s a good fit, please fill out our brief questionnaire so we can get an idea of your technical background and skill set: https://forms.gle/o2jQMtGAk8xWX4c47\n\nIf we feel like it’s a good fit, we’ll reach out and set up a video conference. \n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nWhat You’ll be Working On\n\nAt Threshold, interns aren’t paper pushers. You won’t schedule meetings, take coffee orders, or organize files \n\nYou’ll work on real projects– projects you’re excited about– projects that have a real impact on our company, our products, and our customers. And you’ll leave with real-world technical, creative, and business skills. \n\nWe're looking for someone with solid front end skills to a) help build out critical new features we built over the past couple months post Covid and b) help optimize the existing platform and increase our Lighthouse scores. \n\nThe intern will basically own these projects in terms of scoping hours, execution, optimization, so it's a great showcase project.  \n\nProject Development\nWe work in 6 week development cycles as laid out by the team at Basecamp (https://basecamp.com/shapeup). In short, it consists of 1) figuring out what to work on for the 6 week cycle  2) assigning responsibilities 3) reducing risks and 4) shipping on time.  \n\nLocation\nOur company is 100% remote so you can work from anywhere you want as long as you have a solid internet connection. \n\nCommunication\nWe’re not fans of organized meetings and other non-essential interruptions, in fact we avoid them as much as possible. With the exception of brief Monday video syncs where we discuss our plans for the week, our communication occurs asynchronously. We use Slack and ClickUp as our primary modes of communication, which we’ll provide you access to. \n\nTime Commitment\nOur internships require a commitment of at least 20 hours a week for 12 weeks. How you choose to manage those hours is completely up to you. \n\nCompensation\nUnfortunately, because we’re a boot-strapped startup with a distaste for debt, our internships are currently unpaid. That being said, unlike a lot of other internships you will be working on important, interesting projects so, at the very least,  you will have left with real-world experience and projects you can point to on your resume.\n\nABOUT YOU\n\nYou have direct experience with our stack– and can show it\nCoding isn’t a hobby–it’s your passion. Your Github or Gitlab repos show lots of activity.\n\nYou’re passionate about the arts.\nYou’re not just a technician, you’re a creative. You may or not be an “artist” per se, but you understand the internal drive to create and know first-hand the struggle that comes from pursuing one’s art form.\n\nYou’re meticulous about your work\nYou’re the kind of person who, after building something great, takes a step back and wonders how you can make it better.\n\nYou’re always learning\nYou’re not content with the status quo. You have an insatiable appetite to learn more, to understand better, to make new connections. When you don't understand how something works, you take the initiative to teach yourself. \n\nYou care about people\nYou enjoy the presence of other human beings and genuinely care about their well-being. You feel totally fine around people who don’t look/think/talk like you.\n\nYou’re confident and humble\nYou’re firm in your convictions but also know full well that you don’t know it all. You’re more interested in finding the best ideas than being right.\n\nYou are an excellent communicator\nWhether you’re typing or talking, writing an article or giving a speech– you’re a clear and confident communicator.\n\nYOUR TECHNICAL SKILLS\n\nThe tech choices below represent our goal of making everything as fast and lightweight as possible. An ideal candidate will have first hand knowledge of each of these and/or their corollaries or can show they're a quick study.\n\nFrontend\n\n• Preact\n• Parcel\n• Redux-Bundler\n• Preact-i18n\n• Firebase Hosting, Auth, and Storage\n• GraphQl queries\n• Google Maps API\n• Google Timezone API\n• Cypress.io\n• Polyfill.io\n• Stripe.js\n• Workbox\n• Mailchimp (non-transactional emails)\n• Mandrill (transactional email)\n\nABOUT THE PLATFORM\n\n-Threshold is a fully responsive Progressive Web App built with the explicit goal of making everything as fast and lightweight as possible.\n\n-Our platform is already built so the next 12-18 months will be spent maintaining, optimizing and adding a few new features.\n\n-We received a top-tier grant into Google's startup program by the Dir. of Engineering and Head of Startup Programs who have both shown interest in the platform from a technical and cultural standpoint.\n\n-The founder, Peter Nelson, attended Earnest Capital’s invite-only Founders Summit this March. \n\n-We have established trademarks in the US and across 60+ other countries.\n\n-We have extensive documentation, hours of screencasts, and architectural diagrams so it should be relatively straightforward to jump into the project.\n\nABOUT US\n\nThreshold is a Public Benefit Corporation with a mission to bring Artists a sustainable, living wage. Our platform, helps Artists of all kinds– musicians, authors, speakers, subject matter experts, or anyone else with a fan base– find their fans all over the world and put on events in their fans’ home or business. \n\nWe’re a creative, unconventional company looking for a creative, unconventional engineer to join us on our adventures. Our platform will be officially launching in the coming weeks so we need someone great to take us there.",

More here: www.stateofplace.co\n\nYou: An empathetic, eager-to-learn, data-driven/research/product development enthusiast, who is looking to get a taste of the startup rollercoaster, ready to assist us in our software and product development efforts to help us scale the business using AI/visual machine learning/data analytics. You want to love life while working with a dynamic group of just plain-good people working to make the world (at least slightly) better! \n\nPrimary Job Requirements: \n\n\nUser research, information architecture, wireframing, and prototyping\nProficiency in one or more of the following languages: Python, Javascript, Typescript.\nExperience designing and laying out web pages using CSS and modern supporting libraries. \nExperience with modern Javascript frameworks like React, Webpack, and Rollup required. \nExperience using React compatible CSS styling libraries like react-bootstrap, style-components, etc. a plus. \n\n\nThe Skinny: State of Place can be traced back to 2003, when our Founder/CEO, Mariela, accidentally became a data-geek while creating a tool to objectively measure the built environment characteristics that impact the way people feel about their cities. She soon embraced this new-found title, and began her consulting company, realizing that quantifying what made for good urban design - and calculating its tangible value - was actually the key to convincing people to make cities better (and thereby improve people's lives). Fast forward 15 years later, five years after first offering State of Place as a consulting product, we were awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation's Small Business Innovation Research program that funded the MVP (first saleable version) of our software. Two years later, we have worked with nearly 30 customers in the US and Europe and counting!\n\nJob Responsibilities:\n\n\nCandidate will be primarily responsible for design, layout, and style work to support a complex revenue producing website.\nCandidate will work on the design of a wide variety of interfaces, including map-based, reporting, searching, and extensive data management. \nOther skill-development opportunities associated with the job include dev-ops work, API interaction with servers, backend python work, and machine learning.\n\n\nWhat you get: This is an unpaid internship, but you'll get a ton of on-the-job training (you'd be mentored by our Founder/CEO, CTO, and Machine Learning Scientist), enjoy flexible working hours, and gain invaluable experience working with an innovative, fast-paced startup. We also encourage interns to develop a professional development project that they can use to demonstrate improving a skill set or a deliverable/example of professional growth during the internship. \n\nDuration:\n15-40 hours per week; min. 4 month commitment\n\nLocation:\nRemote (work anywhere with internet access) but preference for those based in North America and Europe (and time zones that line up with them)\n\nJoin us in disrupting the urban planning and real estate industries - replacing the top-down, opinion-based, expert-driven approach accessible to a few with a data-driven, evidence-based one, accessible to the many!\n\nWe hope you're as stoked as we are to meet you/us!

You’ll learn engineering and big data best practices, and be exposed to business strategies that you wouldn’t get at “bigco” for two more decades. At least. This is an unpaid opportunity, so if you’re looking to maximize your pay, go apply to internship programs at Facebook or Google. If you’re lucky, someone might look at your code one day. \n\nIf you want to write code that will be immediately useful and work with the largest offline data science company that both Google and Facebook turn to for item-level data, then we have opportunities for you. With COVID-19 nothing is a given, but we guarantee that we will further the career of those willing to work, learn, and hustle, whether with our company or elsewhere.\n\nCompany Profile\nSociety is producing increasing volumes of data yet brick and mortar has not kept up with the opportunities. That’s not only troubling for your main street merchant, but also for the multi billion-dollar industries that surround the brick and mortar ecosystem: suppliers, distributors, utility operators, real estate funds, and others. \n\nWhatsBusy is the offline point of sale (POS) data monopoly. Really. We access petabytes of POS data from tens of thousands of merchants and proprietary data from the card networks (think Visa, Mastercard, AMEX) and are using intelligent, prescriptive analytics built on the back of data science to solve these challenges. From helping merchants better allocate labor to giving Budweiser insights on what promotions to run, we’re providing much needed modernization to an industry (offline commerce) that’s arguably stuck in the middle ages. \nWhy You Shouldn’t Apply\nYou thrive in environments with zero accountability and negligible execution. You like punching the clock from 9-5 and not a minute more. You want to work on “problems” that are already solved and a guaranteed roadmap 10 years out. Titles are important. \n\nWhy You Should Apply\nYou hate predefined roles based on your age / “experience”. You hate micromanagement. You like building new industries from the ground up. You love learning and being around experts. You are a self-starter. You want to create something important and think too many startups are pointless (how about Uber for mustache combs?). You love data and believe its intelligent application is the future.\n\nAbout the Role\nWhatsBusy is searching for someone who can build and manage front end software products. You must own your work. You will be exposed to marketing, strategy, and business development at senior levels. You must love data, believe in the power of data, and have a natural curiosity to solve real problems with data.

        "description": "Our mission is to reduce preventable blindness in as many people as possible. Our focus is blindness caused by diabetes.Over 40% of Americans are diabetic or prediabetic, and diabetes is the leading cause of blindness among working-age adults. A simple annual eye exam can reduce the risk of blindness by 96%. However, two-thirds of patients fall through the system due to the inconvenience and high cost of visiting eye specialists.At the heart of Preventa stands our drive to prevent blindness by solving the problem of access and cost, enabling early, affordable, and reliable disease detection. Our novel and disruptive portable and low-cost retinal imaging device paired with an autonomous AI diagnostic software system can solve all these problems.We are a seed-stage startup based in Silicon Valley. Our team consists of a well-respected ophthalmologist with 15+ years of clinical experience (ex-faculty member at UPenn), an algorithm developer specializing in computer vision and machine learning at MIT, a Ph.D. student at Stanford EE with extensive relevant background, and a former investor and operator in the healthcare space (Stanford GSB MBA).We have secured 3 patents on our core design, received funding from multiple sources, and already have pilot paying clients.  We are looking for a talented optical engineer or a physicist to join our early team.

From May 16-August 1 author Jordan O'Donnell, his manager, Jake Harris, and eighteen interns will embark on a 10-week cross-country road trip to promote Mr. O'Donnell's forthcoming novel Zoon Garden: The Decline of Nation. The entire trip is employer provided, including one converted school bus, two RV trailers, and fuel. Interns will only be responsible for paying for their food. The team will travel through the majority of America, as well as shoot a documentary of the entire trip. \n\nMr. Harris and Mr. O'Donnell are searching for 1 to 2 individuals to support the tour's SEO and coding needs. Applicants should have high-level coding abilities including extensive experience with python, java, ruby and other popular programing languages. Applicants should also possess thorough knowledge of SEO to include Google Analytics, Google Trends and Google Search Console. \n\nDuties Include:\n• Maintaining the author’s website, including optimizing it for visibility and sales. \n• Designing and coding the author’s website for optimal aesthetic appeal. \n• Assisting media interns with social media maintenance and marketing \n\nPay: The author is a full-time writer, and as such his livelihood is contingent upon the book’s success and at this time he is only able to offer paid 1% commission. If the tour sells 10,000 copies (roughly $35,000), team payout will unfortunately be minimal, $350 per person. If the tour becomes a massive success and sells 300,000 copies (roughly $1,050,000), team payout will be $10,500, and so on and so forth. Regardless of sale numbers, all interns, in exchange for their work, will receive a free ten-week bus trip around the continental United States, including stops in numerous iconic cities and world-renowned sights.\n\nFind further details at www.jordanodonnellauthor.com\nAPPLY NOW via Angellist or at www.jordanodonnellauthor.com/internships",
