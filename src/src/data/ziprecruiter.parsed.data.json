Only traffic on the wire - whether in private data centers, public clouds or enterprise environments - reveals the truth with complete fidelity and independence. Low-fidelity perimeter security only shows what you've already seen, not the hidden attacks that were missed.</p><p>Cognito delivers a far more efficient way of analyzing network traffic at scale. Instead of traditional payload inspection, it uses AI, machine learning and behavioral traffic analysis to expose the fundamental behaviors of attackers as they spy, spread, and steal in the network - even in encrypted traffic.&nbsp;By automating cyberattacker detection, analysis and incident response,&nbsp;Cognito&nbsp;AI condenses days or weeks of work into minutes, reducing the threat investigation workload.

We traditionally bring in a small team of individuals each summer and propose a set of different projects for the team to select based on the team's interests.
