The design of the math elements in chip design, also known as Datapath Design, is nowhere more important than in the design of graphics chips. Graphics cores are filled to the brim with math operations - trigonometry for processing the millions of triangles, texture and lighting computations, ray-tracing, GPU compute operations, machine learning word loads. </p><p>The list goes on. The 'Datapath' design determines the power consumption, the frequency and the numerical correctness of the chip. The design of optimized &amp; functionally correct Datapath brings math directly in contact with electronics and computer science. </p><p>The internship position is within 'The Numerics Group', a new applied research group focusing on all aspects of mathematical hardware design from architecting, RTL implementation &amp; optimization and formal verification. The group works as an internal consultancy to the GPU cluster groups within 3D &amp; Media IPs. The group is founded on the premise that deep mathematical and logical reasoning can deliver significant hardware benefits in terms of reliability, speed, area and power efficiency. </p><p>Crucially, the group uses formal verification tools which mathematically prove the correctness of the hardware we design. We seek to grow our body of knowledge in all aspects of numerical hardware design. From automatic design space exploration through to accuracy analysis, the Numerics group offers and faces a myriad of fascinating opportunities &amp; challenges. </p><p>Our aim is for our work to contribute and participate in best in class numerical hardware design within graphics, Intel's arithmetic community and on the international computer arithmetic stage; to engage with &amp; grow into international experts. The Opportunity As part of seeding the group's expansion we are looking to hire talented interns who will share our passion for computer arithmetic and our value of quality, innovation and insight. Given the range of fascinating challenges the group faces, we have a whole range of projects to match the candidate's skills &amp; interests and the group's latest goals. </p><p>Project examples: Formal Super Usage - create an internal tool which using the latest in formal verification technology to find and remove arithmetically dead code. In complex Datapath algorithms, some hardware may actually be redundant but impossible to find by basic linting tools or code review. Transcendental Function Optimization - transcendental function implementation in hardware is a deeply non trivial design problem. </p><p>Polynomial datapath is efficiently implementing in hardware, how to best map transcendental functions into polynomial datapath is a design and formal verification challenge. Invent new ways of implementing and formally verifying floating-point hardware. Automatic Design Space Exploration - some algorithms in graphics are error tolerant. </p><p>This project explores automatically exploring functionally different designs which are still correct from the application point of view but may have vastly different power, performance and area characteristics. The design space is truly enormous, machine learning algorithms will be required to explore this deeply non convex space. Behavioral traits that we are looking for: Our success hinges on understanding the needs of others, creating ideas with others, being &amp; wanting to be understood by others, growing others as we grow ourselves. </p><p>We work within the evolving diverse team that is Visual Technologies Team. Successful ideas must be generated as well as disseminated both require equal energy. You are: Highly inquisitive Scintillating attention to detail Expertly able and interested in providing complete, clear and concise delivery of complex material, whether emailed, presented, documented or verbalized tailored to the audience. </p><p>Excellent creative analytic problem solving skills Qualifications You must possess the below minimum qualifications to be initially considered for this position. Preferred qualifications are in addition to the minimum requirements and are considered a plus factor in identifying top candidates. Experience listed below would be obtained through a combination of your school <span class=\"long-word\">work/classes/research</span> and/or relevant previous job and/or internship experiences. </p><p>Minimum Skills and Experience that we are looking for: Must be pursuing a Bachelor's, Master's or PhD in mathematics, electrical or electronic engineering or computer science You should have 6+ months of educational or work experience in Data Structures or Algorithms Desirable Skills and Experience that will make you stand out: Understanding of floating point arithmetic Hardware Formal Verification awareness Are you passionate about this opportunity and ready to help us create the next generation of technologies that will transform the future for decades to come?

We design, develop, integrate, market and service these advanced machines, which enable our customers - the world's leading chipmakers - to reduce the size and increase the functionality of their microchips, which in turn leads to smaller, more powerful consumer electronics. Our headquarters are in Veldhoven, the Netherlands, and we have 18 office locations around the United States including main offices in&nbsp;Chandler Arizona, San Jose and San Diego California, Wilton Connecticut, and Hillsboro Oregon.</p><p>In the CLS division in San Diego, we design and manufacture Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lasers, used directly in the chipmaking process. Far from a basic \"consumer\" laser, these machines are complex, powerful, and flexible. The lasers we make require: durable and high-speed precise motion-controlled optics to maintain wavelength to femtometer accuracy under high laser powers; advanced materials to endure the harsh Fluorine-rich environments and high powers; clever mechanical designs to allow high performance and fit all the parts within a confined space, but still allow easy manufacturing and servicing; very fast high power electronics and electrical designs to deliver short high voltage pulses at precise timing to control pulse energy within hundredths of a percent; gas flows at hurricane speeds to keep the laser discharge area clear; cutting edge controllers and algorithms to deliver stable and consistent performance and automate all operations; and advanced real-time electronics, firmware and software to control the laser and interact with other equipment. The laser needs to minimize use of expensive or rare resources like energy or Neon gas. It needs to actively control temperatures, pressures, gas concentrations and voltages precisely to maintain good performance. It must react instantly to changing customer demands and environmental conditions. And it needs to do all of this, operating continuously and reliably for months while producing billions of perfect light pulses, without any human intervention or downtime. </p><p><em>\"This position requires access to controlled technology, as defined in the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. 730, et seq.). Qualified candidates must be legally authorized to access such controlled technology prior to beginning work.

You will receive credit for all qualifying experience, including volunteer experience. Your resume must clearly describe your relevant experience; if qualifying based on education, your transcripts will be required as part of your application. Additional information about transcripts is in this document.<br><br><strong>Basic Requirement for Civil Engineer:</strong><br><br>A. Degree: Bachelor's degree (or higher degree) in engineering. To be acceptable, the program must: (1) lead to a bachelor's degree (or higher degree) in a school of engineering with at least one program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET); OR (2) include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics.<br><br>OR<br><br>B. Combination of Education and Experience: College-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the physical and mathematical sciences underlying engineering, and (2) a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the engineering sciences and techniques and their applications to one of the branches of engineering. The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following:<br><br>1. Professional registration or licensure - Current registration as an Engineer Intern (EI), Engineer in Training (EIT), or licensure as a Professional Engineer (PE) by any State, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions.<br><br>2. Written Test - Evidence of having successfully passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination, or any other written test required for professional registration, by an engineering licensure board in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico.<br><br>3. Specified academic courses - Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and that included the courses specified in A above. The courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of an engineering program.<br><br>4. Related curriculum - Successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in an appropriate scientific field, e.g., engineering technology, physics, chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology, may be accepted in lieu of a degree in engineering, provided the applicant has had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. Ordinarily there should be either an established plan of intensive training to develop professional engineering competence, or several years of prior professional engineering-type experience, e.g., in interdisciplinary positions.<br><br><strong>In addition to meeting the basic requirement above, to qualify for this position you must also meet the qualification requirements listed below:</strong><br><br><strong>Specialized Experience:</strong> One year of specialized experience which includes: 1) Experience applying engineering principles to analyze transportation infrastructure and/or systems; 2) Experience planning, directing, and conducting studies relating to transportation infrastructure and/or systems; and 3) Experience with engineering project management. This definition of specialized experience is typical of work performed at the next lower grade/level position in the federal service (GS-12).<br><br><strong>Some federal jobs allow you to substitute your education for the required experience in order to qualify. For this job, you must meet the qualification requirement using experience alone--no substitution of education for experience is permitted.<br><br>Time in Grade Requirement:</strong> Applicants who have held a General Schedule (GS) position within the last 52 weeks must have 52 weeks of Federal service at the next lower grade or equivalent (GS-12).<br><br>You will be evaluated on the basis of your level of competency in the following areas:<ul><li>Civil Engineering</li><li>Communications</li><li>Planning and Evaluating</li></ul>Education: <strong>FOREIGN EDUCATION: </strong>If you are using education completed in foreign colleges or universities to meet the qualification requirements, you must show the education credentials have been evaluated by a private organization that specializes in interpretation of foreign education programs and such education has been deemed equivalent to that gained in an accredited U.S. education program; or full credit has been given for the courses at a U.S. accredited college or university.

To be acceptable, the program must: (1) lead to a bachelor's degree in a school of engineering with at least one program accredited by ABET; or (2) include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics; <em><strong>OR</strong></em><br><br><strong>Combination of Education and Experience: </strong>Combination of education and experience -- college-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the physical and mathematical sciences underlying engineering, and (2) a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the engineering sciences and techniques and their applications to one of the branches of engineering. The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following:<br><br><strong>1. Professional registration or licensure</strong> -- Current registration as an Engineer Intern (EI), Engineer in Training (EIT)1, or licensure as a Professional Engineer (PE) by any State, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions.<br><strong>2. Written Test </strong>-- Evidence of having successfully passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination or any other written test required for professional registration by an engineering licensure board in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.<br><strong>3.

Please note that qualifications determinations are based solely on the information submitted for each particular vacancy announcement. You must document all requirements on every vacancy; we cannot use previous determinations as a basis for rating. All required information must be received by the closing date of this announcement, and non-submission of all required <span class=\"long-word\">documents/documentation</span> will result in non-consideration.
