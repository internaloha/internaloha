We are looking to identify, train, and develop the next generation of technical leaders. The Evolve rotation program offers you the opportunity to grow, both personally and expertly, through a variety of curated projects, assignments and teams. Participants benefit from a combination of training and on-the-job work experience. \n\nEvolve participants will rotate through teams during a 2-year period on a project basis. Upon successful completion of the program, participants will use their training in sophisticated, non-rotating roles within an identified organization.\n\nParticipants are placed on teams that align with their interests and allow them to work on high-impact and meaningful projects within our Apple Cloud Services and Wallet, Payments, and Commerce organizations. \n\nEXAMPLES INCLUDE:\n-  Developing a “Test Environment in a Box” enabling developers to rapidly and reliably test their code as if they were the entire E2E testing team\n\n-  Take a collection of user-reported issues in a narrow area of functionality and reconceive the user experience to address the underlying customer challenges\n\nRotations may be available in the following locations: Cupertino, Austin, New York and London.</span>",
