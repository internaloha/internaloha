If a feature is buggy, dont release it (if it hasnt been released yet), fix it or take it out.)\n\n\nQuality Engineering Challenge\n\n\nOur Quality Engineering organizations mission is to build a quality culture championing a delightful customer experience while enabling teams to efficiently bring high quality software to all markets. We do this by engaging early to ensure customer use cases are tested AND fully automated. We also automate the release process to save human effort, reduce mistakes, and speed overall delivery. Our environment is primarily Selenium, Protractor, Mocha, Chai, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Jira, TestRail, Python, Jenkins, Nomad and Docker. In our collaborative culture, you find plenty of opportunities to improve the quality of our software.\n\n\nResponsibilities\nDesign test plans and test cases for mobile and web applications\nFind, triage, and document bugs worth fixing\nConduct ad-hoc and scripted manual tests\nConvert manual test cases into automated cases in an existing framework using Python or JavaScript\nInvestigate test failures and customer reports using your technical understanding of the product and tools (such as logs) to narrow down repro issues steps and isolate the root problem\nContribute to test frameworks, test tools, and automation for complex, distributed SaaS systems\nYou ensure the product is tested at the appropriate level (unit vs integration vs end to end, API vs UI), reducing unnecessary test cases, intermittent failures, and decreasing execution time.\nDrive quality processes like bug triage, releases decisions, and feature completion criteria\nYou mentor and develop your other team members.\nRequirements\nAvailable for a 12 week internship during summer of 2021\nCurrently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in a technical field such as IT, Engineering, Math, Physics or similar with Computer Science coursework or minor\nCoding experience with any programming language (Prefer experience in Perl/Python/JavaScript)\nFamiliar with front-end technologies, REST web services and/or Databases\nStrong testing aptitude\nStrong level of curiosity\nMust be legally authorized to work in job location without Qualtrics sponsorship now or in the future\n#Eng #University",

        "description": "Internship for Summer 2021\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nOur software engineers are the gurus behind the scenes ensuring our all of our programs are easy to use and bug free. Using a keen eye, you’ll develop software and tools in support of many of our high-impact technology platforms such as operating systems, networks, databases and more. While we’re growing in the software business, you’ll still need to see the big picture and watch for hardware compatibility while even potentially influencing design.\n\nWho You’ll Work With\n\nOur hardworking team members are busy programming magic across the globe on teams such as Engineering, Information Technology, Supply Chain, Customer Experience, Security and Trust, etc.\nYou would play a crucial role in driving next-gen software innovations including cloud, mobile, desktop or security spaces. On any of these teams, you'll get hands-on experience working with applications that make technology accessible no matter what device they’re on. See the possibilities when creativity meets design and build solutions which will transform how we work, live, learn, and play.\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\nPursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or related program\nUp-to-date on programming and scripting languages: C/C++, Python, Java\nPreferred Qualifications:\nKnowledge of Linux, Networking concepts, OS fundamentals, Embedded Development, and/or ML\nHands on QA, Testing, and/or Debugging skills\nExperience with Databases, Web Application Development, and Web Services\nWhy Cisco\n\n#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.\nWe embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box.\nBut “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\nDay to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\nSo, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",

The team’s job is to ensure we develop the right products up front – evaluate risk, ensure our customer’s user needs are met, and help drive craftsmanship, safety, durability and reliability into the product. On the post-market side, they also work closely with regulatory to handle any complaints and implement design changes, as needed, to address quality issues. The role requires someone who has great communication, problem-solving, and technical skills.\n\nProcess Quality\n\nPQE interns collaborate with cross-functional teams to support product sustainment. When non-conforming issues arise in production, it is our responsibility to perform robust root cause analysis and implement effective corrective actions. Do you enjoy deep dive investigations and driving collaboration and communication to achieve issue resolution? If so, you may be a great fit for this team! PQE interns are focused on quality, compliance and continuous improvement. They use their education to work with a variety of tools including CAD for fixture design, root cause analysis methods, LabView, and validation activities to optimize production, inspection, and quality system processes.\n\nSupplier Quality\n\nSQE interns are responsible for all things supplier-related. Stryker uses a number of critical suppliers to manufacture components and finished products, and to provide critical services. This team’s job is to work closely with the suppliers to ensure components and their manufacturing processes meet our required standards. Do you enjoy using your technical background and communication skills to influence suppliers? If so, you might be a great fit for this diverse and talented team! The role requires working closely with internal customers from multiple functions, meeting with suppliers frequently, and the use of both technical and business skills.\n\nResearch & Development\n\nNew Product Development\n\nR&D interns in New Product Development work with cross-functional teams to identify the needs and the goals of future products. They research new technologies, customer expectations, business requirements and regulations. They may work with a variety of tools, including CAD, FEA, and our Test Labs to develop new product concepts. These interns utilize their technical education to design new products and drive them from concept to production.\n\nProduct Engineering\n\nR&D interns in Product Engineering work with cross-functional teams to identify the greatest needs for improvements on current products. They research new technologies, customer feedback, and product performance data to make our products better for Stryker and for our customers. Product Engineering interns work with a variety of tools, including CAD, FEA, Test Labs, and root cause analysis methods. These interns utilize their technical education to improve the safety and efficacy of our existing products.\n\nTest Lab\n\nTest interns partner closely with Test Engineers and R&D to experiment with early prototypes and vet out product designs throughout the design process. What this really means is that they get to be the MythBusters of the division. You think your design can last the entire expected service life? We put it to the test. Just like the show, we quickly design and build fixtures to simulate real life situations. In addition to these experiments, they are ultimately responsible for design verification – the quantitative testing of the technical specifications of the product. A team’s experience ranges from 2 to over 15 years with technical specialties ranging from sterilization, mechanical, electrical, software, and optics.

Join the Software Team's Summer 2021 Internship Program at Ginkgo, and become a part of the next great technological revolution - constructing, editing, and redesigning the living world in order to answer the globe’s growing challenges in health, energy, food, materials, and more. This is your chance to not only develop algorithms and frameworks at the cutting edge of software technologies, but also work side-by-side with the brightest scientists, organism engineers, and more. You'll have the opportunity to contribute to the exciting frontiers of synthetic biology, including DNA design, genome sequencing, and automating experiments at scales previously unheard of.\nAt Ginkgo, our mission is to make biology easier to engineer. Our bioengineers make use of an in-house automated foundry for designing and building new organisms. Today, our foundry is developing over 40 different organisms to make different products across multiple industries. We're looking for motivated Software Engineering Interns who will design, develop, and deploy the software used by Ginkgo scientists to create these new organisms, conduct experiments, control lab robots, and analyze massive amounts of data. You'll collaborate with a team of talented and diverse engineers, product managers, experts in data analysis and bioinformatics, and, of course, your customers – the dozens of biologists and chemists at Ginkgo.\nOur tech stack includes AWS, Docker, Django, REST, GraphQL, React, MySQL, Postgres, Elastic Search, Airflow, and other modern tools and frameworks. Our languages of choice are Python and Javascript, but you must be someone who loves writing elegant code in any language. Most importantly, you should be passionate about making biology the next engineering discipline. The 20th century was all about bits and the awesome technology of computers; the 21st century is all about atoms and the awesome technology of biology. Ginkgo is at the forefront of this revolution. Here's your chance to change the world (rather than selling more ads).\n\n\nWant to learn more about our Software Summer Internship Program?\nCheck out the highlights from our 2020 Interns in this blog post (Part 1 and Part 2).\nRead about how we're growing Ginkgo's platform on our team page and Twitter account.\n\n\nPlease note: this is a paid internship that will take place during Summer 2021.\nProject Examples\nDesigning and implementing tools and workflows for genetic design of genes, metabolic pathways, and genome modifications\nProgramming robots to assemble DNA, modify genomes, culture cells, and prepare assay samples\nDeveloping verification tools for strain construction\nDeveloping data analysis tools and workflows for processing and analyzing next-generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spec data\nDesired Experience and Capabilities\nUndergraduate junior or senior who has demonstrated amazing programming skills through interesting independent programming projects\nLoves to write elegant code\nExcited to work hand-in-hand with the Foundry team to develop the next generation of foundry-for-engineering organisms\nTo learn more about Ginkgo, check out some recent press:\nGinkgo Bioworks Awarded $40MM NIH RADx-ATP Contract to Expand High Throughput SARS-CoV-2 Testing (PR Newswire)\nGinkgo Bioworks CEO on scaling up Covid-19 testing: ‘If we try, we can win’(CNBC)\nGinkgo raises $70 million to ramp up COVID-19 testing for employers, universities (Boston Globe)\nGinkgo Bioworks Redirects Its Biotech Platform to Coronavirus (Wall Street Journal)\nGinkgo Bioworks Provides Support on Process Optimization to Moderna for COVID-19 Response (PRNewswire)\nThe Life Factory: Synthetic Organisms From This $1.4 Billion Startup Will Revolutionize Manufacturing (Forbes)\nSynthetic Bio Pioneer Ginkgo Raises $290 Million in New Funding (Bloomberg)\nGinkgo Bioworks raises $350 million fund for biotech spinouts (Reuters)\nCan This Company Convince You to Love GMOs? (The Atlantic)\n\n\nWe also feel it’s important to point out the obvious here – there’s a serious lack of diversity in our industry and it needs to change. Our goal is to help drive that change. Ginkgo is deeply committed to diversity, equality, and inclusion in all of its practices, especially when it comes to growing our team. We hope to continue to build a company whose culture promotes inclusion and embraces how rewarding it is to work with engineers from all walks of life. Making biology easier to engineer is a tough nut to crack – we can’t afford to leave any talent untapped.\n\n\nIt is the policy of Ginkgo Bioworks to provide equal employment opportunities to all employees and employment applicants.\nApply for this job",

To put it mildly, we’re serious about having fun.\nMiscellaneous Benefits—Not all benefits are about the Benjamins, baby. Some of the things you’ll enjoy while working here include unlimited soda, tea, lemonade and beer (of course only if of age). And don’t worry about your duds—casual is the dress code here. Still looking to make your cubicle-shackled intern friends jealous of your new gig? Our company-wide social and recreational activities are sure to do just that.\nReady to come aboard?\n\nPlease include a cover letter. Resumes without one won't be considered. Seriously.\n\nWhile we genuinely appreciate your interest in employment with Firespring, we can only respond to the most qualified candidates.\n\nFirespring is an EEO/AA employer.",

With more than 600 million registered users across 180 countries, were on a mission to design a more enlightened way of working. Dropbox is headquartered in San Francisco, CA, and has 12 offices around the world.\n\n\nTeam Description\n\n\nNew graduates and interns at Dropbox work alongside industry leaders, architecting the growing family of products that handle over a billion files a day for people and businesses around the world.

Our goal is to create a robust and impactful learning experience. Additionally you will connect with fellow interns, establish mentors, collaborate with other Dropboxers, and build the foundation of a strong professional network. We will work to accommodate your school end and start dates but this internship has a minimum of a twelve (12) week duration over the summer.\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\nAs an intern, you will go toe-to-toe with Dropbox engineers. We offer numerous types of roles and teams that you can have an impact on. Here are some of the things you may do:\nApplication Engineering- You will build delightful full-stack user experiences that tackle real customer needs and help drive tons of revenue for Dropbox. As a product engineering intern you can expect to work across backend, API, desktop, mobile and web.\nInfrastructure Engineering- Craft the building blocks that let us scale Dropbox to handle millions of concurrent connections, hundreds of billions of files and hundreds of petabytes of data.\nAnalytics Engineering- Measure, optimize, and build one of the industrys most advanced analytics platforms to derive meanings from vast amounts of data. Our massive scale means youll work with more data than many other analytics firms combined.\nMobile Engineering- You are an Objective-C, Swift, Java and C++ magician - this team knows the ins and outs of iOS and Android SDK and will help you weave and bend the APIs to craft the Dropbox client experience on mobile devices. You are also responsible for building the backend systems that power the mobile experiences and optimize the protocol between client and server for reliability, efficiency and speed.\nFront End Engineering- You will work collaboratively to help keep our websites up and running - Dropbox.com and paper.dropbox.com! In addition to everything application engineers do but you are also deeply interested in building a fast, scalable, and responsive Dropbox experience for the modern web, using cutting-edge technologies like Typescript, React, and Redux.\nSite Reliability Engineering (SRE)- This team lives dangerously on the boundary of software and hardware - they have a deep understanding of the inner workings of our product and are committed to ensuring our products work well on real-world hardware in our data centers. You will build the software and automation that controls the hardware that runs our products, and serve as the first line of defense when something goes with our production infrastructure or services.\nSecurity Engineering- People trust Dropbox to keep their data secure, and at Dropbox we rely on our security engineers to make our products safe. You are a software engineer with a deep interest in building software that is secure yet easy to use. A passion for the shadowy computer underworld is a definite plus. Security engineers collaborate with product teams to secure our software, production infrastructure, website, desktop and mobile apps and our corporate infrastructure and devices.\nMinimum Qualifications\nCurrently pursuing a BS (or higher, e.g., MS, or PhD) in Computer Science or related technical field involving coding (e.g., physics or mathematics), or equivalent technical experience\nPreferred Qualifications\nExperience writing or shipping software as part of internships, personal projects, coding competitions or research and the work we do at Dropbox resonates with you, we would love to learn more about you!\nStudents with a passion to learn, problem solve, and challenge the status quo\nBenefits and Perks\nDedicated Mentorship\nMarket competitive salary\nIntern Hack Week\nHousing stipend\nEmployee Resource Groups\nDropbox is an equal opportunity employer. We are a welcoming place for everyone, and we do our best to make sure all people feel supported and connected at work.

Magazine named us one of 50 honorees nationwide for their inaugural Best Workplaces Award in 2016.\nFirespring received the 2018 Community Impact Award, which honors companies that go above and beyond through philanthropy and volunteering.\nIn 2014, we became the first Certified B Corporation in Nebraska, joining 2,000+ companies leading a global movement to redefine success in business.\nOur B Corp status cements our core purpose of leveraging our people, products and profit to do more good.\nThat’s the skinny on who we are. Now we want to tell you about who we’re looking for.\n\nJob Description\n\nSoftware Engineering Intern—pretty straight forward, don’t you think?\n\nBut Firespring looks for something different in the interns we hire. In addition to producing some stellar code, our engineers work in a highly proactive environment. Our average day is spent coding, problem solving, strategically thinking, and exceeding the expectations of our clients. In our opinion, that’s the perfect workplace.\n\nIf you agree, read on.\n\nQualifications\nDo you take the initiative to work independently yet work well with a team? Let's talk.\nYou’re familiar with object-oriented languages like PHP or Ruby.\nDo you pretty up the world around you with web development languages like CSS, HTML(5) and Javascript?\nIs your thinking driven by patterns similar to MVC and Three Tiered Architecture?\nYou’re not a fool. You know constant learning is the key to staying on top, and you’re not afraid to learn a few new things.\nCompensation and Benefits\nSalary—Hourly, we like to take care of our interns and your parents will like that you don’t need to hit them up…as much.\nHours—20 hours per week, flexible.\nFun—Millions of people go to work, punch the clock from 8 to 5 and hate every moment of it—that’s not the case here. We have an indoor slide, a game room that includes shuffleboard, a pool table, a foosball table, a Ping Pong table and more. To put it mildly, we’re serious about having fun.\nMiscellaneous Benefits—Not all benefits are about the Benjamins, baby. Some of the things you’ll enjoy while working here include unlimited soda, tea, lemonade and beer (of course only if of age). And don’t worry about your duds—casual is the dress code here. Still looking to make your cubicle-shackled intern friends jealous of your new gig? Our company-wide social and recreational activities are sure to do just that.\nReady to come aboard?\n\nPlease include a cover letter. Resumes without one won't be considered. Seriously.\n\nWhile we genuinely appreciate your interest in employment with Firespring, we can only respond to the most qualified candidates.\n\nFirespring is an EEO/AA employer.",

The inherent complexity of the process and the limited size and availability of agriculturally relevant datasets has hampered progress in fully understanding crop growth to date. However, as an industry leader and with access to unique and increasingly rich agricultural datasets, The Climate Corporation is positioned to make significant advances in understanding this problem.\n\nIn addition to its complexity, there are a number of practical challenges to modeling crop growth. These include the heterogeneity of the data in terms of its feature modality and sampling frequency, lack of explanatory features, and unpredictable quality of the data. Multi-task learning has recently gained popularity in the field of deep learning to help tackle the challenges of similarly complicated and poorly constrained real-world problems including self-driving vehicles, natural language processing and numerous medical applications.

        "description": "Looking for a new gig? Well, you’re in luck.\n\nFirespring, one of Nebraska’s fastest-growing companies, is looking for a rock star to join our crew. In corporate speak, we provide printing, marketing, software and strategic guidance to thousands of brands, businesses and nonprofits. But nobody gets excited about corporate speak, so here’s the real scoop.\nWe bask in the Silicon Prairie, with offices in Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska, and Council Bluffs, Iowa.\nFirespring only hires passionate, ambitious people—the type who “bring it” every day, have each other’s back and truly give a shit.\nWith clients in all 50 states and on 5 continents, you could say we get around.\nInc. Magazine named us one of 50 honorees nationwide for their inaugural Best Workplaces Award in 2016.\nFirespring received the 2018 Community Impact Award, which honors companies that go above and beyond through philanthropy and volunteering.\nIn 2014, we became the first Certified B Corporation in Nebraska, joining 2,000+ companies leading a global movement to redefine success in business.\nOur B Corp status cements our core purpose of leveraging our people, products and profit to do more good.\nThat’s the skinny on who we are. Now we want to tell you about who we’re looking for.\n\nJob Description\n\nSoftware Engineering Intern—pretty straight forward, don’t you think?\n\nBut Firespring looks for something different in the interns we hire. In addition to producing some stellar code, our engineers work in a highly proactive environment. Our average day is spent coding, problem solving, strategically thinking, and exceeding the expectations of our clients. In our opinion, that’s the perfect workplace.\n\nIf you agree, read on.\n\nQualifications\nDo you take the initiative to work independently yet work well with a team? Let's talk.\nYou’re familiar with object-oriented languages like PHP or Ruby.\nDo you pretty up the world around you with web development languages like CSS, HTML(5) and Javascript?\nIs your thinking driven by patterns similar to MVC and Three Tiered Architecture?\nYou’re not a fool. You know constant learning is the key to staying on top, and you’re not afraid to learn a few new things.\nCompensation and Benefits\nSalary—Hourly, we like to take care of our interns and your parents will like that you don’t need to hit them up…as much.\nHours—20 hours per week, flexible.\nFun—Millions of people go to work, punch the clock from 8 to 5 and hate every moment of it—that’s not the case here. We have an indoor slide, a game room that includes shuffleboard, a pool table, a foosball table, a Ping Pong table and more. To put it mildly, we’re serious about having fun.\nMiscellaneous Benefits—Not all benefits are about the Benjamins, baby. Some of the things you’ll enjoy while working here include unlimited soda, tea, lemonade and beer (of course only if of age). And don’t worry about your duds—casual is the dress code here. Still looking to make your cubicle-shackled intern friends jealous of your new gig? Our company-wide social and recreational activities are sure to do just that.\nReady to come aboard?\n\nPlease include a cover letter. Resumes without one won't be considered. Seriously.\n\nWhile we genuinely appreciate your interest in employment with Firespring, we can only respond to the most qualified candidates.\n\nFirespring is an EEO/AA employer.",
