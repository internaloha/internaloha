You're passionate about the visual display of quantitative information. You excel at telling stories with data, and elucidating the meaning of statistical information and data visualizations for clients.\n\nAlso, you understand the need to make pipelines fit seamlessly with analytics and with the data collection process. Thus, you write maintainable code, and communicate closely with other team members who depend on your pipeline. You can appreciate the sensitivity and confidentiality of users' health data, and therefore recognize how critical it is to handle this information in a secure fashion.Responsibilities\n\n\nCreating visualizations to deliver data-driven insights to customers\n\n\nAutomate the process of turning analytical results into high-quality visual reports.Create colorful data stories that engage customers and clearly explain insights.Deliver reports quickly and at scale.Carefully portray the meaning of nuanced statistical information.\n\n\nStoring and processing health care data\n\n\nDesign schemas for organizing health care data into a tabular form and combining multiple types of health care data from multiple sources.Understand and follow security requirements for storage and processing of sensitive information.\nPreparing data for predictive modeling\n\n\nExtract features from raw data streams, working closely with the analytics team to design features.Communicate feature extraction algorithms with well-documented code, clear explanations, and visualizations.\nUsing exploratory data analysis to find key insights\n\n\nGenerate hypotheses about our dataCreate plots and statistics from the data to check hypothesesMake your exploratory data analysis clear and well-documented\n\n\nRequired Qualifications\n\n\nCapable of exploratory data analysis using Python (Jupyter, pandas, matplotlib).Competent with shell scripting (bash).Basic statistical understanding, including concepts such as regressions, statistical significance, and histograms.Excellent at reliability, communication, and promptness.Quick learner - you're able to learn a new stack of tools as necessary.\n\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\n\nProficient at data visualization (e.g. Python, Tableau, etc).Experience working with sensitive data in a secure manner.Experience with cloud computing (AWS, Google Cloud).Experience with document design tools (e.g. Adobe InDesign).Experience with web design; able to make custom html templates.Strong creative ability to communicate quantitative information in unique and compelling ways.\n\nInternship Program Benefits\n\nAt Aware Healthcare you can expect much more than just a competitive hourly rate.\n\nHere are some of the many benefits you can expect as part of your internship experience:\n\nEarly-stage startup experience: you'll get in on the ground floor of a new digital healthcare company and experience true innovation first-hand.Portfolio projects: you'll be given the freedom, trust, and resources you need to own projects from start to finish that directly impact people's lives.Summer case study: at the end of the program, we'll help you create/publish a case study showcasing your summer projects for future employers (here's an example).Letter of recommendation: by the end of the summer, your direct supervisor will write a personal letter of recommendation for you to use in future job applications.Future job referrals: for months after your internship, you'll have exclusive access to work opportunities that arise in our groups' 300+ company network.Professional mentorship: you'll receive direct training, guidance, and oversight from a supervisor who has 5+ years of experience in your chosen field of work.Networking opportunities: you'll meet and work alongside incredibly smart, driven, and resourceful teammates; build relationships that last your whole career.Real impact: you'll walk away from the summer with having positively influenced the trajectory of people in recovery, and tangible work products that prove it.\n\n\nWho We Are: Aware Healthcare Inc.\n\n Our MissionAware Healthcare is on a mission to build the “thermometer for the mind”: a digital medical device that delivers real-time measures of clinical risk to providers, about their patients, at the moments they need it most.\n\nThe current gold-standard of evaluation in psychiatry are pen & paper surveys that provide subjective, episodic, high-burden, and clinic-based measures of risk. Our thermometer allows providers to check the ‘mental temperature' of their patients — in an objective, continuous, ecological, and passive fashion — at any time.Our VisionWith our thermometer, providers know who needs help, and when they need it. Not only does this shine light into the black box that currently defines life outside the clinic, but it allows providers to deliver just-in-time interventions to patients before it's too late. Trust in providers grows when patients know they're being looked out for. Population health flourishes when high-risk gets detected early. Per capita costs plummet when rates of readmission are reduced. Welcome to the triple-aim of healthcare.\n\nWe envision a world where we all have the vocabulary to describe how we're mentally feeling; self-awareness to identify when we're heading down a dark path; and tools to get help in minutes not weeks. We can't manage what we don't measure, so we see no more important problem than this for technology in healthcare.Our WhyWe are starting with addiction for several reasons. For one, it seems we've all been affected by or lost friends and family who have struggled with this chronic disease. Two, addiction is the most costly, preventable, and unmanaged disease in America; costing our nation over $700 billion per year and leading to over 70 other comorbid medical conditions. Three, most digital healthcare companies have run away from addiction, because they see the problem as ‘too hard'; the patients as ‘unmanageable'; the suffering as ‘inevitable'. With over 16% of Americans meeting criteria for clinical addiction, and another 32% classifying as risky users, we see this as too big of a problem to ignore.\n\nJoin us in redefining what it means to know thyself, reconsidering how we measure population health, and revolutionizing the way we manage mental healthcare. Join us at Aware Healthcare.How We Will Collaborate: Culture & Values\n\n Work CultureWe're a small team looking for someone who's passionate about democratizing self-knowledge; relentless about getting help to those who need it most. You should be comfortable exploring outside your comfort zone; be ready to learn and constantly take on new challenges.\n\nYou should be known by your colleagues for never compromising on quality, while always moving quickly. On our team, no one is expected to know everything, but everyone is expected to be capable of learning independently, and applying that knowledge effectively.\n\nThis is a fast-paced role with many concurrent responsibilities, and it comes with a great deal of ownership. Chances are you will grow more in this role than any other role of your career. This idea should excite you, rather than scare you.Team ValuesBeing on the Aware Healthcare team means you...\n\nTake ownership: the buck stops at you; you are individually responsible.Are proactive: you take initiative; identify problems before they happen.Embrace risk: take courageous & calculated risks; no one gets banished for making mistakes.Are radically candid: you expect truth and nothing but the truth; give & take constructive criticism.Have a growth-mindset: we believe you can always be better & you should too; no one has ever ‘made it'.Are insatiably curious: you have a desire to understand the world that can never be fully satisfied.Practice humility: you don't know everything and you never will; embrace that and learn.Focus on humans: always feel into the human experience at the other end of the machine.Are playful: you work hard, laugh hard, and crack jokes in meetings.Think slow: you choose careful deliberation over brash decisions.\n",

        "description": "The ExperienceHere at University Growth Fund, we give students an unparalleled learning experience. Students have opportunities close to that of a partner or director at a venture capital or buyout firm. Students meet directly with the entrepreneurs and other investors, asking the hard questions as they drill down to the company’s investment attractiveness. The students drive the due diligence process forward and ultimately play a key role in determining whether or not UGF invests from it multi-million dollar fund. Once an investment is made, students often have the opportunity to sit in an observer role on the board of the company and see firsthand how successful companies are managed and operated. Student associates are also able to add additional value to the company over time through various value-add research and strategy projects. Meeting with entrepreneurs and investors, sitting on boards, sourcing new deals are all ways in which students are able to build an extensive network and gain new experiences and skills.The ProgramStudents are brought on for one semester as interns. Those that perform well are invited to stay on in the Fund and are promoted to associate. Associates take on a more autonomous role and have more freedom and flexibility to choose the projects they work on. During this time, associates work to refine an investment area of expertise. After approximately one year, associates who perform well are promoted to senior associate. Senior associates lead the deals and projects at University Growth Fund and maintain relationships with the entrepreneurs and other investors in the deal.TrainingNew UGF interns are brought up to speed on the industry through an accelerated 7-week training program to teach them the basics of VC and PE investing. From there, UGF provides additional training to help students further refine their skills and areas of expertise. Senior associates enjoy a more individualized training program that provides a deeper dive into investment and business issues through a more mentored approach. However, Not all training is focused purely on VC and PE investing. UGF creates an individualized career preparation program for each new student with the express goal of helping that student achieve their career aspirations. In addition, UGF provides other opportunities to learn and grow through subsidized trips and access to numerous conferences throughout the year like the Consumer Electronics Show, ACG Utah, and Techcrunch50.RecruitingWe are on the constant lookout for those that will be the next generation of entrepreneurial leaders. These future leaders come from a diverse set of backgrounds including Finance, Biology, English, Math, Computer Science, Engineering, Economics, and so on. Many of our student associates plan to pursue careers in entrepreneurship, intrapreneurship, investment banking, management consulting, private equity and venture capital. We look for students for whom we can add a lot of value, because their goals are correctly aligned with our program and because they have the drive to succeed and take full advantage of our program. The two basic traits we look for in all candidates are:\n\n\n\nIntellectual Horsepower: The ability to think analytically and strategically is key in our area of investing. One must often attempt to predict the future with very little information and make crucial decisions that have a real impact on our organization’s investment performance. In addition, there is a steep learning curve here at UGF, one that will require your very best.\nDesire: This is an unpaid internship, and like most good things in life, you will get from it what you put in. This might entail “pulling an all-nighter” to finish a deal analysis in time to make the close date on the investment. It will mean monetary and leisure sacrifices. But for those that have the desire, they will gain experiences others only dream of.\n\n",
