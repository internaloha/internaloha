Analog Garage creates advanced algorithms in the domains of computer vision, machine learning and other engineering subfields. We are looking for an intern to develop software tools that can visualize large sets of 3D and 2D imagery.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>Years ago, two \"research-grade\" dataviewers were created which enabled user exploration of point clouds and picture corpora. The first prototype three-dimensional visualization tool is based on scene graphs with level-of-detail pyramiding. It can interactively display billions of 3D points via as-needed disk paging. This dataviewer also allows users to select 3D regions of interest for various computer vision applications.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>The second software tool allows users to explore the global structure as well as drill-down into individual views for tens of thousands of 2D images. This prototype image search system's front-end includes a web browser thin client and graph viewer thick client whose states remain synchronized via a message queue. Its back-end server accesses a database which stores imagery metadata, attributes and topological relationships. Combined thin and thick client exploration provides a practical means for gaining comprehensive insight into large picture collections.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>Today, we seek to build brand new \"demonstration-grade\" versions of both imagery visualization tools. The new dataviewers will be based on current software standards and code libraries. In addition to enabling user interaction with large colored point clouds, the new 3D visualization system will also accommodate textured triangulated meshes and other graphics primitives. It should achieve real-time playback among thousands of point clouds containing hundreds of objects tracked in world-space. The new 2D image search tool will exploit deep learning advances to rapidly construct image graphs for hundreds of thousands of stills and video frames. It should also allow users to request GPU-accelerated keypoint matching among image graph subsets.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>We are specifically looking for software developers with prior experience handling large imagery datasets and building user-friendly tools. If these challenging visualization projects sound exciting, we encourage you to apply!</p><br>\n<p><br>\n<b>Qualifications:</b></p>\n<ul><li>A bachelor’s or master’s degree in Computer Science or Computer Graphics is required.</li>\n<li>Candidates must also possess a strong background in software development.</li>\n<li>Experience working with OpenSceneGraph or similar high performance computer graphics toolkits is particularly important for the 3D dataviewer project.</li>\n<li>Experience working with Java's Abstract Window Toolkit or similar 2D graphics environments is important for the image search project.</li><br>\n</ul><p></p><p>To apply, visit careers.analog.com and apply to the “Imagery Visualization Software Intern\" position.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>For positions requiring access to technical data, Analog Devices, Inc. may have to obtain export licensing approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce - Bureau of Industry and Security and/or the U.S. Department of State - Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.

You may work on building our mobile app, securing the cloud, helping us assess device security, or helping us kill VPNs and passwords. On our team you will find: musicians, hackers, hikers, gardeners, birders, and board game enthusiasts all working together to make Duo the most loved and trusted company in security.\n<br><br>\nOur teams are focused on questions like:\n<ul>\n <li>How do we balance security and ease of use?</li> <li>How do we make strong security ubiquitous, so that organizations of all sizes can afford to be protected with strong security?</li> <li>How do we make security software so easy to use that users don’t resist it?</li>\n</ul>\nIf these sound interesting to you, come join our team. Our people are our secret weapon. And together we build solutions that are easy, effective, dependable, and enduring.\n<br><br>\nWe are committed to cultivating and preserving a culture of inclusion and connectedness. We are able to grow and learn better together with a diverse team of employees. The collective sum of the individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, innovation, self-expression, and talent that our employees invest in their work represents not only part of our culture, but our reputation and Duo’s achievement as well. In recruiting for our team, we welcome the unique contributions that all potential candidates can bring in terms of their education, opinions, culture, ethnicity, race, sex, gender identity and expression, nation of origin, age, languages spoken, veteran’s status, color, religion, disability, sexual orientation and beliefs.\n<br><br>\nAnd if this role is exciting to you, we encourage you to apply even if you don’t meet all 100% of the description or qualifications. Finally and most importantly, we are a proud Equal Opportunity Employer.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Does this sound like you?</strong>\n<ul>\n <li>You love working as part of a fast paced team.</li> <li>You can tackle tasks independently in support of your team's goals.</li> <li>You want to actively participate in creating a great place to work.</li> <li>You drive results for the business, while upholding our \"kinder than necessary\" value.</li> <li>You want to work on a problem (internet security) that has deep consequences at both a personal and geopolitical scale.</li> <li>You know how to code and are currently enrolled in an accredited degree granting program.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Additional skills you have:</strong>\n<ul>\n <li>Deep understanding of computer science fundamentals and software engineering with an aptitude for learning new technologies</li> <li>Experience with a modern programming language or framework (C/C++, Python, Java, Objective-C)</li> <li>A bias toward action and an intense desire to grow your skill set</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>3 reasons why you should apply:</strong>\n<ul>\n <li>You want to work on important projects that ship to 1000’s of customers; no throwaway intern work here</li> <li>You are eager to learn about the ins and outs of professional software development at a dynamic organization</li> <li>You love collaborating with, guiding, and learning from high-performing peers on software projects</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Tips to make your application stand out:</strong> While academics are a strong signal to us, good grades aren't the only thing that matters to us.\n<ul>\n <li>Have a technical side project? Tell us about it. (Previous examples include an intern who built a Pacman emulator.)</li> <li>Past internships are a great way to show how you've made an impact and applied your knowledge to a real customer problem.</li> <li>We love to hear about experiences you’ve had where you’ve: learned something new, taken leadership / ownership of a project, helped / taught others, and/or delivered results.</li> \n</ul>\nWe hope this list makes what we look for less ambiguous, but it’s not meant to be limiting! Tell us what makes you unique.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Internship Details:</strong>\n<ul>\n <li>We’re hiring Software Engineering interns based out of our Ann Arbor, Michigan and Austin, Texas offices</li> <li>Program dates are: May 24 through August 20</li>  <li>Roles are full time and 40 hours per week, Monday - Friday</li> <li>Generous pay and employee perks</li></ul> </div>\n<br>\n<div>#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.\n<br><br>\nWe embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\n<br><br>\nBut “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\n<br><br>\nDay to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n<br><br>\nSo, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!</div></div>\n\n<br>Apply Now",

With over $5 billion in revenue, ADI specializes in high-performance analog, mixed-signal, power, and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits that sense, measure, interpret, connect, power, secure and transform how the world experiences the world around them.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>The Analog Garage Research Lab in Boston, MA develops innovative and groundbreaking technologies for Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI). Analog Garage creates advanced algorithms in the domains of computer vision, machine learning and other engineering subfields. We are looking for an intern to develop software tools that can visualize large sets of 3D and 2D imagery.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>Years ago, two \"research-grade\" dataviewers were created which enabled user exploration of point clouds and picture corpora. The first prototype three-dimensional visualization tool is based on scene graphs with level-of-detail pyramiding. It can interactively display billions of 3D points via as-needed disk paging. This dataviewer also allows users to select 3D regions of interest for various computer vision applications.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>The second software tool allows users to explore the global structure as well as drill-down into individual views for tens of thousands of 2D images. This prototype image search system's front-end includes a web browser thin client and graph viewer thick client whose states remain synchronized via a message queue. Its back-end server accesses a database which stores imagery metadata, attributes and topological relationships. Combined thin and thick client exploration provides a practical means for gaining comprehensive insight into large picture collections.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>Today, we seek to build brand new \"demonstration-grade\" versions of both imagery visualization tools. The new dataviewers will be based on current software standards and code libraries. In addition to enabling user interaction with large colored point clouds, the new 3D visualization system will also accommodate textured triangulated meshes and other graphics primitives. It should achieve real-time playback among thousands of point clouds containing hundreds of objects tracked in world-space. The new 2D image search tool will exploit deep learning advances to rapidly construct image graphs for hundreds of thousands of stills and video frames. It should also allow users to request GPU-accelerated keypoint matching among image graph subsets.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>We are specifically looking for software developers with prior experience handling large imagery datasets and building user-friendly tools. If these challenging visualization projects sound exciting, we encourage you to apply!</p><br>\n<p><br>\n<b>Qualifications:</b></p>\n<ul><li>A bachelor’s or master’s degree in Computer Science or Computer Graphics is required.</li>\n<li>Candidates must also possess a strong background in software development.</li>\n<li>Experience working with OpenSceneGraph or similar high performance computer graphics toolkits is particularly important for the 3D dataviewer project.</li>\n<li>Experience working with Java's Abstract Window Toolkit or similar 2D graphics environments is important for the image search project.</li><br>\n</ul><p></p><p>To apply, visit careers.analog.com and apply to the “Imagery Visualization Software Intern\" position.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>For positions requiring access to technical data, Analog Devices, Inc. may have to obtain export licensing approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce - Bureau of Industry and Security and/or the U.S. Department of State - Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.

For the past 50 years, Analog Devices has been inventing innovative technologies that transform lives. Get hands-on experience working with the brightest minds to solve complex problems that matter: from autonomous vehicles, drones and factories to augmented reality to remote healthcare. Enjoy a culture that values aligned goals, balanced work-life priorities, continuous learning throughout your career and shared rewards. At ADI, we invest in you and succeed together because we believe that happy, healthy, intellectually-challenged people drive our growth and market leadership.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>ADI at a Glance</p><br>\n<p></p><p>ADI helps customers bridge the physical and digital worlds with unmatched technologies that solve real-life problems and make the world smarter, healthier, greener and safer. With over $5 billion in revenue, ADI specializes in high-performance analog, mixed-signal, power, and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits that sense, measure, interpret, connect, power, secure and transform how the world experiences the world around them.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>The Analog Garage Research Lab in Boston, MA develops innovative and groundbreaking technologies for Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI). Analog Garage creates advanced algorithms in the domains of computer vision, machine learning and other engineering subfields. We are looking for an intern to develop software tools that can visualize large sets of 3D and 2D imagery.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>Years ago, two \"research-grade\" dataviewers were created which enabled user exploration of point clouds and picture corpora. The first prototype three-dimensional visualization tool is based on scene graphs with level-of-detail pyramiding. It can interactively display billions of 3D points via as-needed disk paging. This dataviewer also allows users to select 3D regions of interest for various computer vision applications.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>The second software tool allows users to explore the global structure as well as drill-down into individual views for tens of thousands of 2D images. This prototype image search system's front-end includes a web browser thin client and graph viewer thick client whose states remain synchronized via a message queue. Its back-end server accesses a database which stores imagery metadata, attributes and topological relationships. Combined thin and thick client exploration provides a practical means for gaining comprehensive insight into large picture collections.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>Today, we seek to build brand new \"demonstration-grade\" versions of both imagery visualization tools. The new dataviewers will be based on current software standards and code libraries. In addition to enabling user interaction with large colored point clouds, the new 3D visualization system will also accommodate textured triangulated meshes and other graphics primitives. It should achieve real-time playback among thousands of point clouds containing hundreds of objects tracked in world-space. The new 2D image search tool will exploit deep learning advances to rapidly construct image graphs for hundreds of thousands of stills and video frames. It should also allow users to request GPU-accelerated keypoint matching among image graph subsets.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>We are specifically looking for software developers with prior experience handling large imagery datasets and building user-friendly tools. If these challenging visualization projects sound exciting, we encourage you to apply!</p><br>\n<p><br>\n<b>Qualifications:</b></p>\n<ul><li>A bachelor’s or master’s degree in Computer Science or Computer Graphics is required.</li>\n<li>Candidates must also possess a strong background in software development.</li>\n<li>Experience working with OpenSceneGraph or similar high performance computer graphics toolkits is particularly important for the 3D dataviewer project.</li>\n<li>Experience working with Java's Abstract Window Toolkit or similar 2D graphics environments is important for the image search project.</li><br>\n</ul><p></p><p>To apply, visit careers.analog.com and apply to the “Imagery Visualization Software Intern\" position.</p><br>\n<p></p><p>For positions requiring access to technical data, Analog Devices, Inc. may have to obtain export licensing approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce - Bureau of Industry and Security and/or the U.S. Department of State - Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.
