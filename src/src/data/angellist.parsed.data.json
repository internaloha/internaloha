It will need to parametrize and solve for the origin line. I believe it would be better with a surface, but using smaller chunks might be better. I understand the concept. But I think that I am too young of a programmer, insisting that yes I've had no college to be at that level. I just read things. So,if we get $100,000 from the prize, than you will get $60k and I will get $40k. The amounts will be sent to both of us divided. That is how it works. Your name will be on the email to the group. The program must do 1GB of information in 100 hours. It must go beneath the current record of 100MB. And it must fall under 5MB, i believe. That is the lowest amount you can win. Thank you.</p>",

Snorkel started as a research project in the Stanford AI Lab in 2016, creating a higher-level interface to machine learning through programmatically labeled and managed training data. From deploying in some of the world’s largest and most sophisticated tech organizations to empowering scientists, doctors, and journalists — we’ve seen firsthand how this approach democratizes and accelerates AI. Now, we’re building Snorkel Flow to bring our technology to everyone!</p>\n\n<p>Snorkel Flow is the data-first platform for enterprise AI. Modern AI approaches require massive labeled training datasets to learn from, which traditionally rely on armies of human annotators to label by hand. In Snorkel Flow, users programmatically label, build, and augment training data to drive a radically faster, more flexible, and higher quality end-to-end AI development and deployment process. Snorkel Flow is an end-to-end development platform, complete with a GUI and powerful programmatic interfaces for driving the development process for full AI application workflows: from preprocessing, to programmatic training data creation, to ML model training, to analysis, and deployment.

From May 16-August 1 author Jordan O'Donnell, his manager, Jake Harris, and eighteen interns will embark on a 10-week cross-country road trip to promote Mr. O'Donnell's forthcoming novel Zoon Garden: The Decline of Nation. The entire trip is employer provided, including one converted school bus, two RV trailers, and fuel. Interns will only be responsible for paying for their food. The team will travel through the majority of America, as well as shoot a documentary of the entire trip. </p>\n\n<p>Mr. Harris and Mr. O'Donnell are searching for 1 to 2 individuals to support the tour's SEO and coding needs. Applicants should have high-level coding abilities including extensive experience with python, java, ruby and other popular programing languages. Applicants should also possess thorough knowledge of SEO to include Google Analytics, Google Trends and Google Search Console. </p>\n\n<p>Duties Include:<br>\n• Maintaining the author’s website, including optimizing it for visibility and sales. <br>\n• Designing and coding the author’s website for optimal aesthetic appeal. <br>\n• Assisting media interns with social media maintenance and marketing </p>\n\n<p>Pay: The author is a full-time writer, and as such his livelihood is contingent upon the book’s success and at this time he is only able to offer paid 1% commission. If the tour sells 10,000 copies (roughly $35,000), team payout will unfortunately be minimal, $350 per person. If the tour becomes a massive success and sells 300,000 copies (roughly $1,050,000), team payout will be $10,500, and so on and so forth. Regardless of sale numbers, all interns, in exchange for their work, will receive a free ten-week bus trip around the continental United States, including stops in numerous iconic cities and world-renowned sights.</p>\n\n<p>Find further details at <a href=\"http://www.jordanodonnellauthor.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.jordanodonnellauthor.com</a><br>\nAPPLY NOW via Angellist or at <a href=\"http://www.jordanodonnellauthor.com/internships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.jordanodonnellauthor.com/internships</a></p>",

If you’re thinking about alternatives to the remote academic environment this year, consider us. We’re always excited to meet passionate people with a computer science or related background, who want to roll up their sleeves and help us solve some pretty deep technical problems that could, in turn, change the tech landscape as we know it.  </p>\n\n<p>Bubble has a ton of surface area that is passionately loved by its users. Engineers at Bubble own end-to-end feature implementation, continually improve our user-facing experience and develop technology to improve our backend infrastructure. Sharing your skillset and developing your talent as an intern with our team would be a valuable extension of this. If you’re passionate about programming language expressivity, intuitive product design, and infrastructure automation, this is the team to join.  </p>\n\n<p>We tackle problems such as building a query optimizer that runs in the web browser, automating decisions about how to index our users' data, and designing logging and debugging tools that share a vocabulary with our visual editor. Although familiarity with our stack (which includes AWS, Postgres, Redis, Node, Coffee-Script, and ES6) is helpful, it's not a hard requirement. We look for high-achieving, intellectually curious engineers at various levels of professional experience (we do require coding fluency in at least one and preferably several languages). We value communication skills, empathy, those who love problem-solving.</p>\n\n<p>If this sounds like something you’d like to be a part of, please submit your resume, and state the length of time you’d be available to potentially work with us. Semester or full-year interest preferred, but not a deal-breaker. Open to those who are authorized to work in the US through 2021 only.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The team is currently remote for the foreseeable future. If and when things reopen, we invite you to join us in our New York City headquarters. And don’t worry, we’ll supply you with everything you need to work at your best while you’re at Bubble.</strong></p>",

We’re seeking candidates from diverse backgrounds that are just as excited about dating and relationships as we are. Sound like you? Keep reading!</p>\n\n<p>Passion is principal, but it’s equally important that you’re excited to learn about backend or client technologies and what it means to be a team player. And if solving challenging engineering problems at scale makes your heart flutter, we want you for CMB’s Summer Internship Program!</p>\n\n<p>About the Internship</p>\n\n<p>As an intern at CMB, you’ll work on impactful projects with supportive mentors and contribute updates to our code that reach millions of users daily. It’s all part of working toward our company mission: to create real connections that inspire personal growth. That’s because we champion love, but we think that dating and relationships can be used by everyone as a lens for self-reflection, too. </p>\n\n<p>CMB is currently seeking interns to work as backend or iOS engineers. You’ll have opportunities to work on exciting projects, ship code to our 10M+ user base and work in a fast-paced start-up environment. You will be supported through continuous mentorship with a full-time engineer, with regular 1-on-1s to provide regular feedback to ensure a positive internship experience.</p>\n\n<p>Our job can be deeply challenging, but it’s also immensely rewarding and tons of fun! Even if you don't check off all the boxes, we encourage you to apply. CMB recognizes that talent comes from a variety of backgrounds and we would love to hear how you can make an impact here. </p>\n\n<p>This paid internship will take place over 8-10 weeks and is located onsite in our SF (backend/iOS) or Seattle (backend) offices. We do not provide visa or relocation support at this time.</p>\n\n<p>What You'll Bring!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For a backend internship, experience in Python. Experience in Django and SQL would be a plus but is not required</li>\n<li>For an iOS internship, experience in technologies such as Swift, Objective-C, or other object-oriented languages</li>\n<li>Experience working in a team-based environment</li>\n<li>Currently pursuing a degree or bootcamp instruction in software engineering or a related technical field</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are some examples of past intern projects:- Automatic content moderation. This helped improve our event-drives system for automated recognition of faces in photos, suggestive imagery, and abusive language in profiles. It also influenced business decisions and reduced manual workload by making automated moderation decisions in millions of photos!

This helped us find bad actors on our dating site. This project required analytics and a good dose of creativity to find new ways to tackle the problem. In collaboration with our data scientists, new scammer detection models were implemented to greatly reduce the amount of time it took to ban bad actors from our site. </li>\n<li>UI/UX and feature experiments. We’re constantly developing new features and designs, and our past interns have planned, implemented and tested both.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please indicate in your application if you are interested in backend or iOS.

She soon embraced this new-found title, and began her consulting company, realizing that quantifying what made for good urban design - and calculating its tangible value - was actually the key to convincing people to make cities better (and thereby improve people's lives). Fast forward 13 years later, five years after first offering State of Place as a consulting product, we were awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation's Small Business Innovation Research program that funded the MVP (first saleable version) of our software. One year later, we have worked with 15 customers and counting and have an exciting (yet somewhat) untamed, ever-growing list of prospects. </p>\n\n<p>Here's where you come in -- the combination of our Founder's internationally renowned reputation and our uber-aggressive inbound campaigns make it relatively easy to attract leads and interest. Now we just need help qualifying and managing those leads. We're also focusing more and more on exciting outbound marketing strategies and sales and are looking for someone to assist our Sales Manager implement this new system to prioritize, track, follow-up - and yes, close - deals more quickly and effectively in a way that is repeatable and (eventually) scalable. </p>\n\n<p>What you get: This is an unpaid internship, but there is the opportunity for this to transition into a full-time, paid position depending on our close-rate and/or whether we secure outside funding (which we are currently seeking). Clearly, you'll get a ton of on-the-job training (you'd be mentored by our Founder/CEO and our Sales Manager), enjoy flexible working hours, and gain invaluable experience working with an innovative, fast-paced startup. </p>\n\n<p>State of Place was launched in 2016 with the support of a Small Business Innovation Research grant from the National Science Foundation, a highly competitive program. We successfully completed the 2017 Mass Challenge Accelerator program (only 8% out of 1500+ startups were chosen) and the Kickstart Accelerator Smart Cities program in Zurich (where only 2% of applicants were accepted) as well as the Katapult Accelerator Impact Program in Oslo which provided us with investment capital (where again, only 2% of applicants were chosen)! So you'll also get access to amazing mentors we amassed through these programs and have the opportunity to be part of our ongoing, bootcamp-style deep dive into our customer acquisition! </p>\n\n<p>Duration:<br><br>\n15-40 hours per week; min. 4 month commitment</p>\n\n<p>Location:<br><br>\nRemote (work anywhere with internet access) but preference for those based in Boston, New York City, Washington DC, or Metro Detroit.</p>\n\n<p>We are Moneyballing City-making.

We're on a mission to replace the terrible things that engineers have to do to build classroom software (think nightly CSV FTP transfers) with an API that feels more like Facebook's or Stripe's. On the school-facing side, we're looking to become a single place where schools can discover, integrate, and evaluate the dozens of in-class applications they're using.</p>\n\n<p>When we started seven years ago, four schools used Clever. Today, Clever is used by over 78,000 schools, making it the fastest-growing company in education. We're looking for talented engineers who want to help us build Clever into something every school, student, and teacher relies on.</p>\n<h3><strong>A Day in the Life</strong></h3>\n<p>Interns at Clever work alongside full-time engineers, improving existing products and creating apps that live on top of Clever. Our very first intern wrote an iPhone app on the Clever platform that spread to over a thousand schools on the day it was released. Another intern wrote an app that let schools provision Google accounts, which now manages over 2 million student and teacher accounts. </p>\n\n<p>Clever is mostly written in Typescript, Javascript, Node.js, and Go.</p>\n\n<p>This is <em>exclusively</em> a summer 2021 (May - August / June - September) opportunity. </p>\n<h3><strong>Requirements</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Must be graduating in or before June 2022.</strong> Why is this? Clever only offers internships to college students who will be graduating within 9 months of their internship’s completion because we view internships as a path to a full-time offer. The internship program lets us identify and mentor future engineers, while offering the the intern a chance to see what it's like to be part of the Clever team.  At the end of the internship, we hope to be able to build on a great summer by extending our interns an offer to come back and join us!</li>\n<li>Relevant coursework in computer science.</li>\n<li>Past projects demonstrating strong coding ability.</li>\n<li>A desire to grow as an engineer through collaboration, code reviews, and learning new languages/technologies.</li>\n<li>Excellent communication skills</li>\n<li>A desire to work in a diverse, highly collaborative team environment</li>\n</ul>",

HuTouch is Dropbox for your activities, i.e., it will allow users to pick up their activities (apps, data, pointers) from where they stopped when they move between devices. Our 1st launch will help users move their activities seamlessly between Android smartphones and Windows 10 PCs, and vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>With 30 early adopters willfully awaiting a raw prototype, HuTouch needs a React Native mobile application developer intern (specifically for Android) to help accomplish the below goals &amp; tasks (priority as stated):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Research and development to identify solutions for functionalities designed by our early adopters. You will be required to have problem solving skills, study different materials and come up with solutions for  functionalities within HuTouch that are not developed yet. This may take up 40% to 50% of your time on this project.</li>\n<li>Deliver code &amp; User Experience not just with high quality but also with a logical flow in mind. The tasks associated to this job requirement is coding and unit testing, where the intern will need to make sure no critical or high defects creep into the developed code. This may take 30% to 40% of your time on this project. </li>\n<li>Demo of individual features developed and end to end flow. It'll be required for you to present the working app to the founder over a call while you screen share. There is no need for powerpoint presentations here, as this will be a pure demo of the app. This will take up 10% to 20% of your time on this project. </li>\n<li>Understand the flow within HuTouch and apply it to design frameworks for HuTouch. An intern will be asked to read about HuTouch, React Native for Android, to think like an architect and identify any foreseeable risks during implementation. This will take up the remaining time on this project.<br></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http://www.HuTouch.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.HuTouch.com</a> for more details &amp; to see the demo video on our patent pending concept on continuity.</p>\n\n<p>Skills required:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Average to expert coding skills in React Native platform for Android</li>\n<li>Client side coding to interact with APIs for AWS or cloud solutions</li>\n<li>Problem solving skills that drives the urge to solve by looking at a problem from different angles/scenarios and presenting with multiple solutions.</li>\n<li>Communication skills to articulate the problem and clarify assumptions</li>\n<li>Self reliant to move the project forward</li>\n</ol>",

The primary focus will be to implement new user interfaces and features. We have had an app developed by a company using a generic architecture. This was primarily a business decision to quickly deploy an app and begin to garner users. This will provide valuable information that will help guide our designs for future iterations of the app.</p>\n\n<p>You will primarily be working alone (as far as hands on app work) but very closely with the Founder for vision and direction. We are wanting to shift our UI/UX as well as add additional features that the current app does not have. Your knowledge and advice about application architecture and the newest mobile technologies will be highly appreciated. You’ll also help ensure solid application performance and an excellent user experience.</p>\n\n<p>We are a start-up and looking for someone who is comfortable growing with the company. As this is more of an intern-type position, equity is being offered (as a portion of app sales) instead of salary. As the company and app usage grows, this arrangement can be revisited. </p>\n\n<p>Responsibilities</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Developing new features and user interfaces from wireframe models</li>\n<li>Ensuring the best performance and user experience of the application</li>\n<li>Fixing bugs and performance problems</li>\n<li>Writing clean, readable, and testable code</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Skills</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Extensive knowledge about mobile app development.

Two robotics entrepreneurs, Tyler Mantel, Founder of Watertower Robotics, and Alex Frost, founder of Florabot, teamed up to directly address the biggest problems with ventilators during the Covid-19 pandemic: the cost of ventilators, which can be upwards of $40,000 apiece, and the lack of parts to build them given the bottlenecks in the supply chain for medical grade parts. The Ventilator Project’s mission is thus to rapidly prototype, build and ship ventilators built from readily available parts at a fraction of the price ($5,000).</p>\n\n<p>THE ROLE</p>\n\n<p>The Ventilator Project is in search of an on-site Firmware Engineer intern to join our firmware team and help develop control software for our ventilator. The responsibilities of this role include: Developing drivers and control logic for various system control components and sensors in bare-metal C, contributing to architectural design documentation, unit-testing software components, carrying our Failure Modes and Effects Analysis on software components, upholding software quality standards, and working in a fast-paced team environment.</p>\n\n<p>QUALIFICATIONS:</p>\n\n<p>Required Skills:</p>\n\n<p>2+ year's experience (professional or otherwise) in Low-level embedded C.<br>\nWorking experience in an agile development environment and with source-control platforms (Git) strongly preferred.<br>\nExperience with Arm cortex microprocessors<br>\n 30+ hours/week commitment</p>\n\n<p>Ideal Skills:</p>\n\n<p>Background in Medical devices design<br>\nPrevious work experience in start-up companies/environments</p>\n\n<p>The team comes from a diverse set of backgrounds and skill sets, but each of us share a common calling: we couldn’t continue to sit and wait. We knew it was time to step up and find a solution.</p>\n\n<p>LOCATION: Boston, on-site</p>\n\n<p>DISCLOSURE: Current on-site volunteers are working in an isolated office setting while practicing safe social distancing practices. We have gloves and masks readily available, and the office space is professionally cleaned several times throughout the week. We also have had several hostels/hotels provide free housing for our volunteers as well as an on-site chef to provide free meals. </p>\n\n<p>To apply for this position, please fill out the following Google Form: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9HCBEaAA-mbUvD0a92R9Opcx6eVMmPM4s3JRlEFCIl72yNQ/viewform?usp=sf_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9HCBEaAA-mbUvD0a92R9Opcx6eVMmPM4s3JRlEFCIl72yNQ/viewform?usp=sf_link</a></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, email the following information to <a href=\"mailto:N.Anderson@TheVentilatorProject.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">N.Anderson@TheVentilatorProject.org</a>: (1) Position Applied For, (2) First and Last Name, (3) Phone Number, (4) Email Address, (5) Resume (if applicable), and (6) LinkedIn url (if applicable).
