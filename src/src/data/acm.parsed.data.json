Our vision is to combine the performance of bare metal networking while maintaining all the benefits of the cloud, including delivering features not possible on bare metal i.e. true Software Defined Networking (SDN).<br><br>We are growing fast, and are looking for C programmers who can deliver ultra-high performance code - our goal is to be processing many millions of packets per second on embedded CPU cores. This requires both being able to implement highly optimized data structures, but also low level tuning to our hardware.
