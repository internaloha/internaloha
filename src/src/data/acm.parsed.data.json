Redshift delivers ten times faster performance than other data warehouses by using machine learning, massively parallel query execution, and columnar storage on high-performance disk.<br><br>Amazon Athena is a serverless query engine built to analyze structured and unstructured data stored in S3 using standard SQL. Athena requires no clusters to manage and tune nor infrastructure to setup or manage and scales automatically to TB of data for complex queries. Customer can use Athena to also create S3-based data lakes.<br><br>Amazon Aurora, Redshift and Athena Engine teams are looking for software developers who are passionate about databases and large-scale storage system technologies, and excited about building database systems that run across thousands of servers across multiple datacenters worldwide. These are core systems development positions where you will grow to own the design and development of significant system software components critical to our industry leading database services architected for the cloud.<br><br>We are looking for candidates who are exceptional in systems programming, data structures and algorithms, and advanced databases. Research and hands-on experience working in database research groups and labs is preferred.
