Digital endpoints offer opportunities to improve what we know about patients’ biologic processes and clinical functioning or responses to treatment, in both clinical trials and routine clinical care. In order to replace less reliable Clinical Outcomes Assessments (COAs) (e.g., Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) or observatory outcomes), more flexible data processing and analysis methods are needed to analyze these wearable sensor data. This project will focus on the standardization and pipelining of current wearable datasets, as well as on the development of novel analytical methods to answer specific questions about clinical outcomes. The project will additionally focus on investigating time series analysis methods and comparing these head-to-head with processed data methods for performance evaluation. The outcome of this project will be to have a set of resources for a variety of currently under-explored methods for time series analysis, and to have a more comprehensive understanding of how time series data from wearable devices differs from summary parameters, and what types of clinical questions can or should be addressed with each method.\n<br><br>\nThis intern project will be highly collaborative between Early Clinical Development &amp; Experimental Sciences (ECD&amp;ES)/Precision Medicine and Clinical Outcomes Assessment/Patient Innovation and will contribute significantly to the continual development and improvement of Regeneron’s scientific capacity to process wearable sensor data, an increasing feature of clinical trial innovation.\n<br><br>\n<b>Desired Majors:</b><br>\nComputer science, electrical engineering, physics, mathematics, chemistry, biological sciences (any quantitative sciences).\n<br><br>\n<b>Necessary Technical Skills:</b><br>\nExperience with areas such as digital signal processing, detection, synchronization, channel coding/decoding, parameter estimation &amp; tracking, and machine learning. Proficiency with modeling in Python, R, or MATLAB. Strong attention to detail and curiosity of how digital technologies work. Teamwork: the candidate must be able to communicate well with cross-functional team members, be able to efficiently collaborate with others to achieve project goals on short timelines, and contribute positively to the Global Development community. Strong writing and communication ability (for presentations and publications).\n<br><br>\n<b>Desired Degree level:</b> Bachelor / Master / PhD\n<br><br>\n<b>In this role, a typical summer might include the following:</b><br>\nAchieving a general understanding of what happens in our global organization\n<br>Completing hands-on project work that has an impact on the business\n<br>Engaging with Regeneron leadership\n<br>Collaborating with other interns\n<br>Establishing connections with Regeneron’s diverse employee pool resource groups\n<br>Participating in professional development sessions while enjoying lots of free food and swag\n<br>Showcasing the knowledge you gained through end of term presentation sessions\n<br>Getting paid for your hard work!\n<br><br>\n<b>This role might be for you if:</b><br>\nYou want to make a difference\n<br>You advocate for your ideas – and what they can do in the world\n<br>You’re excited to think, challenge, listen, re-think and solve\n<br>You continuously look for ways to improve\n<br>You are science-minded, ask questions and challenge conventional wisdom\n<br>You work with precision, passion, intellect and integrity\n<br>You’re ready to work with the team that can bring a great idea to life\n<br>You know this is no ordinary job</div><div></div>",

The selection process (with more details on the 2021 summer assignments) will begin shortly.\n<br><br>\nThe California Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up 80 percent of California's power grid. We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by operating the grid reliably 24/7.\n<br><br>\nAs the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.\n<br><br>\nThe California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others. In the same way, the California ISO operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.\n<br><br>\nJob Description\n<br><br>\nWhat's In it for You\n<br><br>\nOur purpose is to lead the way to tomorrow's energy network. Your work as an intern can impact millions of people who depend on electricity for their everyday lives.\n<br><br>\nYou will get \"real world\" experience to begin or further your career pursuits in the energy industry. This is a paid intern position for 10 -12 weeks during summer 2021.\n<br>You get to work on interesting and challenging assignments that will help grow your skill set.\n<br>You will work in an extremely collaborative environment inside our LEED certified Folsom, California campus.\n<br>Opportunities to interact with the CEO and the Executive team of the ISO\n<br>Invitations to seminars on the latest energy industry topics such as renewables, electric cars and micro grids.\n<br>Potential field trips.\n<br>Social activities with other interns such as barbecues and movie nights.\n<br>You get to work on our \"green\" LEED certified Folsom, California campus with some of the brightest people in the industry.\n<br><br>\nWhat You Will Be Doing\n<br><br>\n<b>Past Assignments have included work such as:</b><br>\nAssist in the management of the CAISO stakeholder initiative processes related to market design, infrastructure planning, and generation interconnection.\n<br>Perform detailed economic and engineering analysis of existing and future market design rules, as well as participate in Market design and development efforts to identify new measures to validate market results that will improve market performance.\n<br>Developing and designing new statistical metrics to monitor the changes in the electricity market.\n<br>Designing and calculating indices for monitoring market performance and market participant behavior.\n<br>Preparing and analyzing data queries, reports, charts and slide presentations to support special studies, investigations, and Board Meetings and Market Monitoring Assessment reports.\n<br>Perform complex mathematical and engineering analysis of market software and advanced power systems application’s results to determine optimality of solutions.\n<br><br>\nQualifications\n<br><br>\nLevel of Education and Discipline\n<br><br>\nCurrently in an Undergraduate, Master’s degree (MS) or PhD program in Economics or related field.\n<br>Graduating December of 2021 or later.\n<br><br>\nAmount of Experience\n<br><br>\nPrevious internships, research or work experience using economic analysis is desired.\n<br>Research and or studies in energy industry highly desired.\n<br><br>\nType of Experience\n<br><br>\nProficient in Microsoft office suite.\n<br>Good presentation, oral and written communication skills highly desirable.\n<br>Must be able to work effectively in a team environment.\n<br>Excellent analytical and problems solving skills required.\n<br><br>\nAdditional skills and abilities\n<br><br>\nStrong quantitative skills.\n<br>Competence in software such as R, Python, SQL, and MATLAB desired but not required.\n<br><br>\nAdditional Information\n<br><br>\nAll your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines.</div><div></div>",
