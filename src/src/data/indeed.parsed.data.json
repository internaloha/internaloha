Using a keen eye, you’ll develop software and tools in support of many of our high-impact technology platforms such as operating systems, networks, databases and more. While we’re growing in the software business, you’ll still need to see the big picture and watch for hardware compatibility while even potentially influencing design.\n\nWho You’ll Work With\n\nOur hardworking team members are busy programming magic across the globe on teams such as Engineering, Information Technology, Supply Chain, Customer Experience, Security and Trust, etc.\nYou would play a crucial role in driving next-gen software innovations including cloud, mobile, desktop or security spaces. On any of these teams, you'll get hands-on experience working with applications that make technology accessible no matter what device they’re on. See the possibilities when creativity meets design and build solutions which will transform how we work, live, learn, and play.\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\nPursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or related program Up-to-date on programming and scripting languages: C/C++, Python, Java\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\nKnowledge of Linux, Networking concepts, OS fundamentals, Embedded Development, and/or ML Hands on QA, Testing, and/or Debugging skills Experience with Databases, Web Application Development, and Web Services\n\nWhy Cisco\n\n#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.\nWe embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box.\nBut “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\nDay to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\nSo, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",

At Microsoft, we also work to empower our employees, so they can achieve more. We believe we should each find meaning in our work and we ensure employees have the freedom and the reach to help make a difference in the world.\n\nResearchers in artificial intelligence are harnessing the explosion of digital data and computational power with advanced algorithms to enable collaborative and natural interactions between people and machines that extend the human ability to sense, learn and understand. The research infuses computers, materials and systems with the ability to reason, communicate and perform with humanlike skill and agility.\nSpeech and language is at the front and center of this AI revolution. Our group at Microsoft builds the most advanced technologies for speech recognition (SR), powering key Microsoft products and services such as Cortana personal assistant, dictation on Windows and Office, Skype speech-to-speech translation, voice control and inputs on Xbox and HoloLens. Our cloud-based technology also enables SR capabilities for numerous third-party applications through offerings on Azure Cognitive Services. The team in Sunnyvale focuses primarily on language modeling (LM) for SR, as well as post-processing of SR results such as rescoring and display formatting. We are a team of world-class scientists and engineers, employing cutting edge machine learning technologies, sophisticated speech and natural language modeling algorithms as well as web-scale data mining techniques, and we follow the best modern engineering practices.\n\nThis internship will focus on advancing the state-of-art deep learning technologies for language modeling. Current neural network LMs have been effective in reducing speech recognition errors in various practical applications. However, there are still significant opportunities for improvement in terms of accuracy, scalability, adaptability, and robustness. The project will address one or more gaps in the current technologies, experimenting with novel network architecture and training algorithms, large scale data mining and processing, directly targeting real-world applications experienced by millions of end users. Past internship projects in our team have resulted in conference publications, patents, and adoption in production service to serve real user traffic.\nResponsibilities\nInterns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world’s best researchers, interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, students are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community.

Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines, to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.\nResponsibilities\nInterns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world’s best researchers, interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides.

Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.\n\nThe intern will do intensive computer simulations of possible symmetry breaking functionals on the space of left invariant metrics on the Lie groups of unitary symmetries of large but finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. The goal is to give an interpretation of many body (qubit or Majorana) physics in terms of simpler single particle models. A backup project would focus on approaches to quantum computation that might be realized via projective measurement of molecular spin states and single qubit gates.\nQualifications\nIn addition to the qualifications below, you’ll need to submit a minimum of two reference letters for this position. After you submit your application, a request for letters may be sent to your list of references on your behalf. Note that reference letters cannot be requested until after you have submitted your application, and furthermore, that they might not be automatically requested for all candidates.
