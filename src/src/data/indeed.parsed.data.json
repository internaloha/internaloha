Our team members provide their expertise to ensure customer success through the design, development and execution of innovative and comprehensive test, verification and validation strategies, processes, tools and techniques. SI&amp;T employees are involved in all aspects of test including: design-for-test, integration, subsystem, and component level testing through Customer sell-off of our most sophisticated systems and technologies.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Systems Engineering Intern</b><br>\n<br>\nWhat is Systems Engineering? What does a Systems Engineer do? Systems Engineering contributes to programs throughout the entire product development lifecycle, from inception through development, sell-off, deployment, and operations and maintenance in the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nSystems Engineers work within an interdisciplinary process that ensures that the customer's needs are satisfied throughout a system's entire life cycle. This process is comprised of the following seven tasks:<br>\n<br>\n1. State the problem. Stating the problem is the most important systems engineering task. It entails identifying customers, understanding customer needs, establishing the need for change, discovering requirements, and defining system functions.<br>\n<br>\n2. Investigate alternatives. Alternatives are investigated and evaluated based on performance, cost, and risk.<br>\n<br>\n3. Model the system. Running models clarifies requirements, reveals bottlenecks and fragmented activities, reduces cost and exposes duplication of efforts.<br>\n<br>\n4. Integrate. Integration means designing interfaces and bringing system elements together so they work as a whole. This requires extensive communication and coordination.<br>\n<br>\n5. Launch the system. Launching the system means running the system and producing outputs to verify that the system does what it was intended to do.<br>\n<br>\n6. Assess performance. Performance is assessed using figures of merit, technical performance measures, and metrics - measurement is the key. If you cannot measure it, you cannot control it. If you cannot control it, you cannot improve it.<br>\n<br>\n7. Re-evaluation. Re-evaluation should be a continual and iterative process with many parallel loops.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Job Description\n</b><br>\n<br>\nOpportunities for Interns require individuals to use engineering, math, and teamwork skills to perform various engineering activities, such as requirements development, system test and validation planning and execution, modeling and simulation, data analysis, flight test analysis, and overall systems integration.

What does a Systems Engineer do? Systems Engineering contributes to programs throughout the entire product development lifecycle, from inception through development, sell-off, deployment, and operations and maintenance in the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nSystems Engineers work within an interdisciplinary process that ensures that the customer's needs are satisfied throughout a system's entire life cycle. This process is comprised of the following seven tasks:<br>\n<br>\n1. State the problem. Stating the problem is the most important systems engineering task. It entails identifying customers, understanding customer needs, establishing the need for change, discovering requirements, and defining system functions.<br>\n<br>\n2. Investigate alternatives. Alternatives are investigated and evaluated based on performance, cost, and risk.<br>\n<br>\n3. Model the system. Running models clarifies requirements, reveals bottlenecks and fragmented activities, reduces cost and exposes duplication of efforts.<br>\n<br>\n4. Integrate. Integration means designing interfaces and bringing system elements together so they work as a whole. This requires extensive communication and coordination.<br>\n<br>\n5. Launch the system. Launching the system means running the system and producing outputs to verify that the system does what it was intended to do.<br>\n<br>\n6. Assess performance. Performance is assessed using figures of merit, technical performance measures, and metrics - measurement is the key. If you cannot measure it, you cannot control it. If you cannot control it, you cannot improve it.<br>\n<br>\n7. Re-evaluation. Re-evaluation should be a continual and iterative process with many parallel loops.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Job Description\n</b><br>\n<br>\nOpportunities for Interns require individuals to use engineering, math, and teamwork skills to perform various engineering activities, such as requirements development, system test and validation planning and execution, modeling and simulation, data analysis, flight test analysis, and overall systems integration.

Our team members provide their expertise to ensure customer success through the design, development and execution of innovative and comprehensive test, verification and validation strategies, processes, tools and techniques. SI&amp;T employees are involved in all aspects of test including: design-for-test, integration, subsystem, and component level testing through Customer sell-off of our most sophisticated systems and technologies.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Systems Engineering Intern</b><br>\n<br>\nWhat is Systems Engineering? What does a Systems Engineer do? Systems Engineering contributes to programs throughout the entire product development lifecycle, from inception through development, sell-off, deployment, and operations and maintenance in the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nSystems Engineers work within an interdisciplinary process that ensures that the customer's needs are satisfied throughout a system's entire life cycle. This process is comprised of the following seven tasks:<br>\n<br>\n1. State the problem. Stating the problem is the most important systems engineering task. It entails identifying customers, understanding customer needs, establishing the need for change, discovering requirements, and defining system functions.<br>\n<br>\n2. Investigate alternatives. Alternatives are investigated and evaluated based on performance, cost, and risk.<br>\n<br>\n3. Model the system. Running models clarifies requirements, reveals bottlenecks and fragmented activities, reduces cost and exposes duplication of efforts.<br>\n<br>\n4. Integrate. Integration means designing interfaces and bringing system elements together so they work as a whole. This requires extensive communication and coordination.<br>\n<br>\n5. Launch the system. Launching the system means running the system and producing outputs to verify that the system does what it was intended to do.<br>\n<br>\n6. Assess performance. Performance is assessed using figures of merit, technical performance measures, and metrics - measurement is the key. If you cannot measure it, you cannot control it. If you cannot control it, you cannot improve it.<br>\n<br>\n7. Re-evaluation. Re-evaluation should be a continual and iterative process with many parallel loops.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Job Description\n</b><br>\n<br>\nOpportunities for Interns require individuals to use engineering, math, and teamwork skills to perform various engineering activities, such as requirements development, system test and validation planning and execution, modeling and simulation, data analysis, flight test analysis, and overall systems integration.

Systems Engineering contributes to programs throughout the entire product development lifecycle, from inception through development, sell-off, deployment, and operations and maintenance in the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nSystems Engineers work within an interdisciplinary process that ensures that the customer's needs are satisfied throughout a system's entire life cycle. This process is comprised of the following seven tasks:<br>\n<br>\n1. State the problem. Stating the problem is the most important systems engineering task. It entails identifying customers, understanding customer needs, establishing the need for change, discovering requirements, and defining system functions.<br>\n<br>\n2. Investigate alternatives. Alternatives are investigated and evaluated based on performance, cost, and risk.<br>\n<br>\n3. Model the system. Running models clarifies requirements, reveals bottlenecks and fragmented activities, reduces cost and exposes duplication of efforts.<br>\n<br>\n4. Integrate. Integration means designing interfaces and bringing system elements together so they work as a whole. This requires extensive communication and coordination.<br>\n<br>\n5. Launch the system. Launching the system means running the system and producing outputs to verify that the system does what it was intended to do.<br>\n<br>\n6. Assess performance. Performance is assessed using figures of merit, technical performance measures, and metrics - measurement is the key. If you cannot measure it, you cannot control it. If you cannot control it, you cannot improve it.<br>\n<br>\n7. Re-evaluation.

It’s time to invest in answers. Only Teradata leverages all of the data, all of the time, so customers can analyze anything, deploy anywhere, and deliver analytics that matter most to them. And we do it on-premises, in the Cloud, or anywhere in between, throughout the world. We call this pervasive data intelligence. It’s the new way we transform how businesses work and people live through the power of data.\n<br><br>\nOur summer internship program lasts 10-12 weeks beginning in May/June and ending in August/September. Fast-paced, flexible, fun. The Teradata culture isn’t just about one kind of person. So many individuals make up who we are, making us that much more unique. It’s what sets apart the dynamic, diverse and collaborative environment that is Teradata.\n<br><br>\nYour Opportunity\n<br><br>\nThe Server Management engineering team is looking for a highly motivated engineering intern who can learn new technologies to help improve our set of tools we use. You will be working under the direction of a mentor, and although you will be working primarily independently you will also be interacting with other members of our highly talented team.\n<br><br>\nThis internship opportunity focuses on taking a prototype diagnostic program and repackaging it into a docker container so that it can be easily integrated into Teradata’s test automation framework. Once operational the task will then be to incrementally enable additional diagnostic checks in the tool to verify the correct configuration of our server management software deployed in Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, and Google’s cloud platforms. By the end of the internship this will have grown to be an important tool for us to ensure newly-provisioned customer systems in the cloud are setup correctly. You will not only be the primary contributor to this effort, and learn new things along the way, but you will also educate your team members about what you’ve accomplished.\n<br><br>\nThe ideal internship candidate is currently working towards a degree in computer science, computer engineering, or related field, is a highly motivated self-starter, and is eager to work with a team of experienced software architects and developers to contribute to the Teradata product set.\n<br><br>\nQualifications/Requirements\n<br><br>\nPassion for writing software\n<br><br>\nProgramming experience on at least one significant project\n<br>Basic knowledge of linux commands\n<br>Knowledge of the bash scripting language\n<br>Must be enrolled in BS/MS/PhD degree program, in computer science or related field\n<br>Any exposure to cloud technologies is a plus",

We’ve assembled a diverse team of experts in artificial intelligence, computer vision, sensor fusion, optics, and data analysis that are creating software and hardware solutions to radically evolve the capabilities of the United States and our allies. If you are passionate about solving problems that have real impact, come join Anduril and build the future of defense.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nAs a Software Engineer Intern working on Sensor Integrations, you write mission-critical code that bridges the gap between the real world and Lattice, Anduril’s Sensor Fusion Platform. Everything Lattice knows about the surrounding environment comes through your code. And every physical action that Lattice takes in the real world — turn a pan-tilt-unit or a propeller - is through your code.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nIntegration of a sensor into Lattice is much more than just “plumbing data.“ You take pride in processing literally every available bit of raw sensor data into low-latency, high-fidelity sensor measurements using advanced perception techniques on the latest low-power edge compute platforms. Further, since operation of Lattice is augmented with a distributed command and control layer, you thoughtfully architect daemons that support seamless control by both Humans and Human-directed agents.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nAs an Anduril engineer intern, you do not just work from the (awesome) office/lab. Lattice works in rugged environments and you will also occasionally work in rugged environments. Going into the field to experience real world sensor behavior and rapidly prototype solutions is often the best way to get reps on a problem and deliver results in hours instead of months.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nYou are well-prepared for this role if you're excited to write C++ code in a production environment and experience the joys (and frustrations) of manipulating directly attached sensors. Your attention to detail is critical to your success; you will quickly become an expert on in-the-weeds idiosyncrasies of device APIs and sensor behavior. You own your integration code from early prototype through deployment in a way that doesn't mean you're the only one that can ever own it. Finally, your contributions to internal tools and frameworks make existing and future integrations even better.</div></div>\n<div><div><h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>Responsibilities\n</b></h3><div><ul><li>Process raw device data into meaningful sensor measurements</li><li>\nDesign and implement sensor daemons that support operation by both human and autonomous planning agents</li><li>\nGenerate health alerts from device failures and deviations in expected performance</li><li>\nBuild systems and tools that make existing and future sensor integrations better</li><li>\nCollaborate with all involved teams (perception, mechanical, electrical, manufacturing, operations) over the full life cycle of sensors</li></ul></div></div></div>\n<div><div><h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>Qualifications\n</b></h3><div><ul><li>Prior engineering internship experience, along with academic pursuits &amp; studies in the areas of: Computer Science, Computer/Software Engineering, Mathematics, or Physics.</li><li>\nFamiliarity with algorithms, data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.</li><li>\nProficiency in a variety of programming languages such as Go, Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, etc.</li><li>\nA desire to work on software and applications that have real-world impact.</li></ul></div></div></div>\n<div><div>U.S. Person status is required as this position needs to access export controlled data.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nAnduril is an equal-opportunity employer, and we encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.
