Once an RA arrives at their host site, they are supervised and mentored by a variety of Forest Service staff, engaging with experts from business, conservation, and science backgrounds, and learning more about careers as they work on vital projects within the Forest Service. Upon completion of the program, RAs receive a 2-year direct hiring certificate with the Forest Service, keeping the door open for exciting career opportunities with their host site, or with any of the 154 national forests across the country.

Do work that matters:</strong></p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\">MobilizeGreen is a national nonprofit committed to jumpstarting green careers for diverse youth and recent graduates, while advancing environmental equity in communities across the country.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\">In partnership with the USDA Forest Service, MobilizeGreen offers internship opportunities for college students (graduating before April 12, 2021), graduate students, and recent graduates. The Resource Assistants Program (RAP) provides flexible internship placements based in National Forests across the US for those interested in Forest Service careers. Resource Assistants work under the mentorship and coaching of Forest Service staff to complete mission-critical work while developing leadership, critical thinking, and strategic communication skills. The RAP was designed for emerging professionals to launch their natural and cultural resources careers.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\">Each MobilizeGreen Resource Assistant starts their journey with a weeklong orientation, where they will meet other RAs and Forest Service staff from across the country and engage in skill building and career development activities. Once an RA arrives at their host site, they are supervised and mentored by a variety of Forest Service staff, engaging with experts from business, conservation, and science backgrounds, and learning more about careers as they work on vital projects within the Forest Service. Upon completion of the program, RAs receive a 2-year direct hiring certificate with the Forest Service, keeping the door open for exciting career opportunities with their host site, or with any of the 154 national forests across the country. MobilizeGreen will enhance your career opportunities, introduce you to key leaders in the natural resource field, and engage you on your career journey to a job with the Forest Service.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"><strong>Position Abstract:</strong> In partnership with the Daniel Boone National Forest and the Forest Service Minerals and Geology Management program, MobilizeGreen seeks a Resource Assistant (RA) intern to help forest staff oversee mineral exploration, development, and reclamation activities related to federal (government owned) and nonfederal (privately owned) mineral estates according to specific authorities, legislation, rules, and regulations.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"></p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"><strong>Work Environment:</strong>The Resource Assistants work under the mentorship and coaching of Forest Service staff to complete mission-critical work while developing leadership, critical thinking, and strategic communication skills.

The RAP was designed for emerging professionals to launch their natural and cultural resources careers.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\">Each MobilizeGreen Resource Assistant starts their journey with a weeklong orientation, where they will meet other RAs and Forest Service staff from across the country and engage in skill building and career development activities. Once an RA arrives at their host site, they are supervised and mentored by a variety of Forest Service staff, engaging with experts from business, conservation, and science backgrounds, and learning more about careers as they work on vital projects within the Forest Service. Upon completion of the program, RAs receive a 2-year direct hiring certificate with the Forest Service, keeping the door open for exciting career opportunities with their host site, or with any of the 154 national forests across the country. MobilizeGreen will enhance your career opportunities, introduce you to key leaders in the natural resource field, and engage you on your career journey to a job with the Forest Service.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"><strong>Position Abstract:</strong> In partnership with the Daniel Boone National Forest and the Forest Service Minerals and Geology Management program, MobilizeGreen seeks a Resource Assistant (RA) intern to help forest staff oversee mineral exploration, development, and reclamation activities related to federal (government owned) and nonfederal (privately owned) mineral estates according to specific authorities, legislation, rules, and regulations.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"></p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"><strong>Work Environment:</strong>The Resource Assistants work under the mentorship and coaching of Forest Service staff to complete mission-critical work while developing leadership, critical thinking, and strategic communication skills.

The Resource Assistants Program (RAP) provides flexible internship placements based in National Forests across the US for those interested in Forest Service careers. Resource Assistants work under the mentorship and coaching of Forest Service staff to complete mission-critical work while developing leadership, critical thinking, and strategic communication skills. The RAP was designed for emerging professionals to launch their natural and cultural resources careers.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\">Each MobilizeGreen Resource Assistant starts their journey with a weeklong orientation, where they will meet other RAs and Forest Service staff from across the country and engage in skill building and career development activities. Once an RA arrives at their host site, they are supervised and mentored by a variety of Forest Service staff, engaging with experts from business, conservation, and science backgrounds, and learning more about careers as they work on vital projects within the Forest Service. Upon completion of the program, RAs receive a 2-year direct hiring certificate with the Forest Service, keeping the door open for exciting career opportunities with their host site, or with any of the 154 national forests across the country. MobilizeGreen will enhance your career opportunities, introduce you to key leaders in the natural resource field, and engage you on your career journey to a job with the Forest Service.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"><strong>Position Abstract:</strong> In partnership with the Daniel Boone National Forest and the Forest Service Minerals and Geology Management program, MobilizeGreen seeks a Resource Assistant (RA) intern to help forest staff oversee mineral exploration, development, and reclamation activities related to federal (government owned) and nonfederal (privately owned) mineral estates according to specific authorities, legislation, rules, and regulations.</p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"></p><p style=\"line-height%3A1.2%3Bbackground-color%3A%23ffffff%3B\"><strong>Work Environment:</strong>The Resource Assistants work under the mentorship and coaching of Forest Service staff to complete mission-critical work while developing leadership, critical thinking, and strategic communication skills.
