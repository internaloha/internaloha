A market-leading, global tech company that equips legal and compliance professionals with a powerful platform to organize data, discover the truth, and act on it. The US Department of Justice, 199 of the Am Law 200, and more than 329,000 enabled users trust Relativity during litigation, internal investigations, and compliance projects.\n<br><br>\nOur SaaS product, RelativityOne, has become the fastest-growing product in the company's history and we have consistently been named a great workplace. As we grow, we continue to seek individuals that will bring their whole, authentic self to our team.\n<br><br>\nWe believe that great talent is not bound by geography and that what you do matters more than where you do it. Relativity has assumed a hybrid work strategy, allowing choice and flexibility for employees to work either from home, a physical Relativity office location (once safe to do so), or a combination of the two, within certain logistical boundaries. Submit your application to learn more from our recruiters or contact us for more details.\n<br><br>\n<ul><li>Below are the teams within Review/Core that are hiring interns:</li></ul>\nCore\n<br>We are modernizing our front-end architecture, and we're looking to grow teams of engineers who are passionate about user experience, automation and performance.\n<br><br>\nYou will be developing brand new features to make clients’ lives easier, and the user interface more intuitive, accessible, and performant. You will be working with JavaScript and frameworks like Aurelia and AngularJS. You will also be writing and maintaining API endpoints utilizing .NET, and connecting with cloud-based services such as Azure Logic Apps or Event Grid. You will be working in a blended build environment of both Node.js and MSBuild.You will be writing unit tests using Jasmine/Karma and NUnit.\n<br><br>\nIf you love solving problems, building great products, working among strong teams, and want to make a visible impact, this role is for you.\n<br><br>\nCase Strategy\n<br>Case Strategy is a suite of applications which empowers case teams to construct winning cases by quickly and easily defining, validating and presenting their case strategy, while benefitting from a seamless integration into Relativity and all its features. Case Strategy consists of Case Dynamics, which assists users in collecting, organizing and analyzing facts, issues, organizations, people, interview questions and documents, while also seamlessly integrating into the Document Viewer and Transcript Viewer, which gives users the ability to upload, review, code, and annotate Transcript files in Relativity.\n<br><br>\nCase Strategy is a newly formed team and is full of energy. If you love solving complex problems and are thirsty for daily challenges, then come and join us, you will not be disappointed. You will mainly be working in JavaScript, Angular, and C#, but will also dabble in Aurelia and Relativity’s internal web components throughout 2020, as we are going to rewrite most of our front-end and make it adherent to the new look and feel of Relativity.\n<br><br>\nReview\n<br>The Review groups work on the Review Interface (RI), the part of Relativity where users spend 85% of their time. The RI is used to look at various documents, mark whether they’re relevant to the case, and optionally to apply redactions to hide sensitive information. We have just released a total rewrite of the RI. We continue to innovate on top of the new RI.\n<br>As part of our team, you will be using technologies such as Type Script, a superset of Java Script, Aurelia framework, and Azure. Projects might include optimizing new components or starting work on advanced features, such as an investigative UI, that will be delivered after the rewrite is done.\n<br><br>\nPotential projects include front end work to implement a new feature, back end Kepler work to support the front end, or build related projects. Past examples include adding a new search term in the front end, an Aurelia message to measure sign of life, or moving our build system to a new internal framework called Trident. We try to have all our projects make it into our shipping product instead of having them be “make work” projects.\n<br><br>\n<b>Responsibilities:</b><br>\nLearn and use new technologies and popular programming languages to design, build, and test our platform, Relativity\n<br>Work on scalable and dynamic web system which supports integration with multiple search engines, clustering, technologies, and client component interaction through web services\n<br>Learn how to build highly distributable systems composed of multiple database, processing, and web servers.\n<br>Actively participate in the SCRUM process\n<br>Troubleshoot issues\n<br><br>\n<b>Qualifications:</b><br>\nCurrent student, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Math or related area of study\n<br>Experience with and a passion for web development\n<br>Desire to work the Agile development methodology\n<br>Effective communicator\n<br>Team player\n<br>At Relativity, we live our core values and we thrive on solving complex problems. We’re dedicated to continually improving our product and providing relentless customer service, and we’re always looking for people to join us on the journey.\n<br><br>\nRelativity is a team of smart, passionate people always looking to grow, contribute, and make our product and customer service the best it can be. Our team members come from diverse backgrounds with different skills and life experiences—and we love and celebrate those differences. We believe that employees are happiest when they’re empowered to be their full, authentic selves, regardless how you identify.\n<br><br>\nSo, please come as you are. We can’t wait to meet you.\n<br><br>\nAll qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin, disability or protected veteran status, or any other legally protected basis, in accordance with applicable law.",

Parents have tried to homeschool their children, and frankly that’s been a challenging balancing act. Students are missing out on not just an education, but also socialization with peers that’s a crucial part of childhood.</p><p>Scout brings together families with our community of learning facilitators to create learning pods. Scout provides the structure for pods to work -- helping families create pods, interview and screen learning facilitators in a highly selective matching process, set predictable rates and payment schedules, provide customizable community guidelines, and have real estate partnerships for pods that request an alternate learning venue.</p><p>This is a unique opportunity to become a core member of an exciting high-growth company and take on an active role in helping to build it from the ground up. This role is for someone who wants to be challenged on a daily basis to solve complex problems and create value for parents, educators, and students.
