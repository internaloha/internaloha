Our technology helps our customers solve their toughest challenges by enabling them to make better, more informed decisions in life-and-death situations. We’ve assembled a diverse team of experts in artificial intelligence, computer vision, sensor fusion, optics, and data analysis that are creating software and hardware solutions to radically evolve the capabilities of the United States and our allies. If you are passionate about solving problems that have real impact, come join Anduril and build the future of defense.\n<br><br>\nAs a Software Engineer Intern working on Sensor Integrations, you write mission-critical code that bridges the gap between the real world and Lattice, Anduril’s Sensor Fusion Platform. Everything Lattice knows about the surrounding environment comes through your code. And every physical action that Lattice takes in the real world — turn a pan-tilt-unit or a propeller - is through your code.\n<br><br>\nIntegration of a sensor into Lattice is much more than just “plumbing data.“ You take pride in processing literally every available bit of raw sensor data into low-latency, high-fidelity sensor measurements using advanced perception techniques on the latest low-power edge compute platforms. Further, since operation of Lattice is augmented with a distributed command and control layer, you thoughtfully architect daemons that support seamless control by both Humans and Human-directed agents.\n<br><br>\nAs an Anduril engineer intern, you do not just work from the (awesome) office/lab. Lattice works in rugged environments and you will also occasionally work in rugged environments. Going into the field to experience real world sensor behavior and rapidly prototype solutions is often the best way to get reps on a problem and deliver results in hours instead of months.\n<br><br>\nYou are well-prepared for this role if you're excited to write C++ code in a production environment and experience the joys (and frustrations) of manipulating directly attached sensors. Your attention to detail is critical to your success; you will quickly become an expert on in-the-weeds idiosyncrasies of device APIs and sensor behavior. You own your integration code from early prototype through deployment in a way that doesn't mean you're the only one that can ever own it. Finally, your contributions to internal tools and frameworks make existing and future integrations even better.\n<br>Responsibilities\n<br>Process raw device data into meaningful sensor measurements\n<br>Design and implement sensor daemons that support operation by both human and autonomous planning agents\n<br>Generate health alerts from device failures and deviations in expected performance\n<br>Build systems and tools that make existing and future sensor integrations better\n<br>Collaborate with all involved teams (perception, mechanical, electrical, manufacturing, operations) over the full life cycle of sensors\n<br>Qualifications\n<br>Prior engineering internship experience, along with academic pursuits &amp; studies in the areas of: Computer Science, Computer/Software Engineering, Mathematics, or Physics.\n<br>Familiarity with algorithms, data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.\n<br>Proficiency in a variety of programming languages such as Go, Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, etc.\n<br>A desire to work on software and applications that have real-world impact.\n<br>U.S. Person status is required as this position needs to access export controlled data.\n<br><br>\nAnduril is an equal-opportunity employer, and we encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. If you are someone passionate to work on problems that matter, we’d love to hear from you!</div><div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"h3\">Full Job Description</div><div class=\"p\">Virtual Internship\n<br><br>\nParticipation in the Research Internship Program requires that you are physically located in the United States or Canada for the duration of the internship.\n<br><br>\nResearch Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers. Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.\n<br><br>\nImmersive digital experiences envelop people and blur the lines between what is real and what is virtual. For audio immersion, technologies such as spatial audio and virtual acoustics provide the tools that when applied to augmented and virtual reality experiences give critical cues that humans use to locate and experience virtual content.\n<br><br>\nMicrosoft's investments in immersive audio are advancing the state of the art in spatial audio and acoustics. Through tight collaboration between research and product development, Microsoft has demonstrated a strong leadership in the industry for both publishing research papers as well as integrating the latest immersive audio technology into innovative products such as HoloLens, Windows Mixed Realty and video games.\n<br><br>\nResponsibilities\n<br><br>\nInterns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world’s best researchers, interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, students are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.\n<br><br>\nAs a research intern working on acoustics research, you'll be responsible for understanding the current state of the art in the industry by reviewing literature relevant to the project focus. Working with your mentor and research partners, you'll choose a direction for how the project should be executed and you'll bring the project to life by implementing a solution that can potentially ship in a Microsoft product. You'll be able to experience both the research and engineering side of life at Microsoft during your internship.\n<br><br>\nQualifications\n<br><br>\nIn addition to the qualifications below, you’ll need to submit a minimum of two reference letters for this position. After you submit your application, a request for letters may be sent to your list of references on your behalf.
