If you're thinking about alternatives to the remote academic environment this year, consider us. We're always excited to meet passionate people with a computer science or related background, who want to roll up their sleeves and help us solve some pretty deep technical problems that could, in turn, change the tech landscape as we know it.<br><br>Bubble has a ton of surface area that is passionately loved by its users. Engineers at Bubble own end-to-end feature implementation, continually improve our user-facing experience and develop technology to improve our backend infrastructure. Sharing your skillset and developing your talent as an intern with our team would be a valuable extension of this. If you're passionate about programming language expressivity, intuitive product design, and infrastructure automation, this is the team to join.<br><br>We tackle problems such as building a query optimizer that runs in the web browser, automating decisions about how to index our users' data, and designing logging and debugging tools that share a vocabulary with our visual editor. Although familiarity with our stack (which includes AWS, Postgres, Redis, Node, Coffee-Script, and ES6) is helpful, it's not a hard requirement. We look for high-achieving, intellectually curious engineers at various levels of professional experience (we do require coding fluency in at least one and preferably several languages). We value communication skills, empathy, those who love problem-solving.<br><br>If this sounds like something you'd like to be a part of, please submit your resume, and state the length of time you'd be available to potentially work with us. Right now, our interest is for Summer and Fall internships for 2021. Open to those who are authorized to work in the US through 2021 only.<br><br><strong>The team is currently remote for the foreseeable future. If and when things reopen, we invite you to join us in our New York City headquarters. And don't worry, we'll supply you with everything you need to work at your best while you're at Bubble.</strong>",
