In our research efforts, we are connecting proven strategies with new intelligent in-silico algorithms to speed the early phase of the drug discovery process. We currently have a 12 week, part-time (20-25 hrs/week) targeted internship opportunity for a skilled and motivated individual who is interested in the application of computational technologies to life science. The internship will provide an outstanding opportunity to learn about the drug discovery process from a team of highly skilled and seasoned drug hunters.<br><br>The central part of the internship project will be to set up a specific conditional recurrent neural network, starting from a known approach and code, and then to enable it to work with and draw insights from chemical information databases, resulting in evolved refinement of the network. As results emerge, a key creative element will be to tune and update the network parameters in collaboration with the drug discovery team to improve algorithm success. The project requires practical knowledge of artificial intelligence and/or machine learning approaches such as Random Forest (RF) and graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) and fluidity with scripting in Python or R. The underlying datasource for the machine learning network will be a set of available databases such as MCule, CHEMBL, etc which match molecules and their structural information with measured activity values. The ideal candidate will have some familiarity with, and be able to understand the content in chemical information databases, and at a minimum will have demonstrated the ability to work with and extract information from large databases (e.g. flat comma-separated files) using Structured Query Language (SQL) and to call application programming interfaces.<br><br>To be fully successful, the candidate will have strong interest in the application of cutting-edge machine algorithm approaches to practical, real-world problems, and will be comfortable interfacing with individuals external to Cerevel as needed, for example, discussing published code with students or researchers as universities that are at the leading edge of developing artificial intelligence networks. In addition to the described project, there is an opportunity to work on a second, applied drug discovery project as time permits. Through participation in team meetings, individual mentorship, and structured learning opportunities, an internship at Cerevel will afford significant opportunities to learn about life science research and unique aspects of the complex and exciting drug discovery process.<br><br>As we continue to monitor the impact of COVID on in-person gatherings, the role will also require ability to function and communicate successfully in a remote work setting, with the majority of interactions currently conducted via teleconference.<br><br>Position requires the candidate to be actively pursuing a degree in either Computer Science or Computational Chemistry (or a suitable equivalent) with examples of successfully starting and completing projects involving coding, scripting, and database manipulation.

        "description": "<strong><u>The Experience<br><br></u></strong>Here at University Growth Fund, we give students an unparalleled learning experience. Students have opportunities close to that of a partner or director at a venture capital or buyout firm. Students meet directly with the entrepreneurs and other investors, asking the hard questions as they drill down to the company’s investment attractiveness. The students drive the due diligence process forward and ultimately play a key role in determining whether or not UGF invests from it multi-million dollar fund. Once an investment is made, students often have the opportunity to sit in an observer role on the board of the company and see firsthand how successful companies are managed and operated. Student associates are also able to add additional value to the company over time through various value-add research and strategy projects. Meeting with entrepreneurs and investors, sitting on boards, sourcing new deals are all ways in which students are able to build an extensive network and gain new experiences and skills.<br><strong>The Program<br></strong>Students are brought on for one semester as interns. Those that perform well are invited to stay on in the Fund and are promoted to associate. Associates take on a more autonomous role and have more freedom and flexibility to choose the projects they work on. During this time, associates work to refine an investment area of expertise. After approximately one year, associates who perform well are promoted to senior associate. Senior associates lead the deals and projects at University Growth Fund and maintain relationships with the entrepreneurs and other investors in the deal.<br><br><strong>Training<br></strong>New UGF interns are brought up to speed on the industry through an accelerated 7-week training program to teach them the basics of VC and PE investing. From there, UGF provides additional training to help students further refine their skills and areas of expertise. Senior associates enjoy a more individualized training program that provides a deeper dive into investment and business issues through a more mentored approach. However, Not all training is focused purely on VC and PE investing. UGF creates an individualized career preparation program for each new student with the express goal of helping that student achieve their career aspirations. In addition, UGF provides other opportunities to learn and grow through subsidized trips and access to numerous conferences throughout the year like the Consumer Electronics Show, ACG Utah, and Techcrunch50.<br><strong>Recruiting<br><br></strong><strong><u>The Two Basic Traits We Look For In All Candidates Are<br><br></u></strong>We are on the constant lookout for those that will be the next generation of entrepreneurial leaders. These future leaders come from a diverse set of backgrounds including Finance, Biology, English, Math, Computer Science, Engineering, Economics, and so on. Many of our student associates plan to pursue careers in entrepreneurship, intrapreneurship, investment banking, management consulting, private equity and venture capital. We look for students for whom we can add a lot of value, because their goals are correctly aligned with our program and because they have the drive to succeed and take full advantage of our program.<br><ul><li><strong>Intellectual Horsepower</strong>: The ability to think analytically and strategically is key in our area of investing. One must often attempt to predict the future with very little information and make crucial decisions that have a real impact on our organization’s investment performance. In addition, there is a steep learning curve here at UGF, one that will require your very best.</li><li><strong>Desire</strong>: This is an unpaid internship, and like most good things in life, you will get from it what you put in. This might entail “pulling an all-nighter” to finish a deal analysis in time to make the close date on the investment. It will mean monetary and leisure sacrifices. But for those that have the desire, they will gain experiences others only dream of.<br><br></li></ul>SDL2019-256",
