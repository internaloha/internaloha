We are dedicated to tackling one of our nation\u2019s biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.</em><em><br></em><em><br></em><em>Nuna is committed to simple principles: a rigorous understanding of data, modern technology, and most importantly, compassion and care for our fellow human. We want to know what really works, what doesn\'t\u2014and why.</em><em><br></em><em><br></em><em>Nuna partners with healthcare payers, including government agencies, health plans, and employers, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.</em></p><h4>YOUR TEAM</h4><p>In Nuna Engineering, we build technology to enable users (from data scientists to analysts to policy-makers) to understand healthcare data while ensuring its integrity, security and privacy. Our work runs the gamut from joining streams of messy real-world data to building queryable data warehouses to building APIs to power healthcare business processes. We build systems that are auditable, automated, accurate, and, most importantly, responsive to our end users\' needs. We strive for a creative, collaborative engineering environment that implements best practices of peer review, readability, maintainability, privacy, and security of the code base and infrastructure.</p><p>The Nuna Meaningful Matches engineering team is responsible for building the APIs, schemas and business logic to power our product. We work with the output of Nuna\u2019s Data Platform, turning large datasets into innovative and highly reliable APIs. Through the usage of machine learning, our APIs bring new capabilities to healthcare - enabling fairer and more accurate matchmaking between doctors and patients in real time.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a high-impact, remote, 12-week paid internship starting in June for students graduating by 2022.&nbsp;</p><h4>YOUR IMPACT</h4><p>Our engineering team builds the product that healthcare companies interact with. We measure our products\u2019 success by how much they improve care, access, and lower costs. As an engineering-led culture, you will be at the vanguard of making healthcare work for all Americans. You\u2019ll be helping patients with access to primary care physicians that match their needs.</p><h4>YOUR OPPORTUNITIES</h4><ul><li style=\\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\\">You\u2019ll put data science magic (predictive analytics, dynamic modeling and machine learning) into our users\u2019 hands through interactive features in collaboration with the Data Engineering &amp; Data Science teams.&nbsp;</li><li style=\\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\\">You\u2019ll design APIs that multiply the effectiveness of external developers serving millions of patients.</li><li style=\\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\\">You\u2019ll observe and interact with our industry leading production environment, ensuring high availability/low latency and protecting our sensitive data with rigorous security and privacy controls.</li><li style=\\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\\">You\u2019ll learn from more senior engineers, because we are learners, not knowers, and you\u2019ll have the opportunity to influence them, because growing Nuna\u2019s people is the most reliable way to scale our impact.</li><li style=\\"font-weight%3A+400%3B\\">You\u2019ll work as part of a team, not in a silo.

The classes focus on developing communication skills so that students are able to put their knowledge to practical use as soon as they step outside the classroom. Our teaching method enables students to develop four basic skills: listening comprehension, speaking, reading and writing. The idea is to learn Spanish in a natural and spontaneous way, just as students have learned their mother tongue. Our students are encouraged to speak Spanish right from the very first day, using it in typical real-life situations: the basic syllabus is supplemented by special exercises, such as role-play, situational dialogues and work projects. Outside the classroom, the learning process continues as you are immersed in the Spanish language and the Dominican culture.</p><p><strong>Contact Information&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Contact Person: Manfred M\xf6nnighoff</p><p>Project/charity name: Fundaci\xf3n Aldeas de Paz</p><p>Address: Samana, Dominican Republic</p><p>Whatsapp: +1 829 7055 123</p><p>E-Mail: <a href=\\"mailto:mail@peacevillages.org\\">mail@peacevillages.org</a></p><p>Webpage: <a href=\\"https://www.peacevillages.org?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\\" target=\\"_blank\\">https://www.peacevillages.org</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\\"https://www.facebook/AldeasdePaz?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\\" target=\\"_blank\\">https://www.facebook/AldeasdePaz</a></p><p>Instagram: <a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/AldeasDePaz?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\\" target=\\"_blank\\">https://www.instagram.com/AldeasDePaz</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/AldeasDePaz?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\\" target=\\"_blank\\">https://twitter.com/AldeasDePaz</a></p><p>YouTube: <a href=\\"http://www.youtube.com/Peacevillages?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=idealist\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://www.youtube.com/Peacevillages</a></p>","index":6,"skills":["machine learning","project management","virtual reality","information technology"],"remote":false},{"position":"Paid Summer Internships in Advocacy & Communications (Remote)","company":"Phi Beta Kappa Society","location":{"city":"Washington","state":"District Of Columbia"},"posted":"2019-07-24T23:04:15.384Z","url":"https://www.idealist.org/en/nonprofit-internship/d09d6a0539b0416da2c01f03a9b028de-paid-summer-internships-in-advocacy-communications-remote-phi-beta-kappa-society-washington","lastScraped":"2021-03-15T23:04:15.384Z","description":"<p>We are excited to share these opportunities for seasonal employment with The Phi Beta Kappa Society\u2019s national office.
